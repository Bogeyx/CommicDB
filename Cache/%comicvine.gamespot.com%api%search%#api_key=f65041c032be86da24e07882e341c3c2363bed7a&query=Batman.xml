Thomas, moving in to protect his wife, was shot by Chill, causing Martha to scream. Chill then shot her, while shouting, "this'll shut you up!". Bruce, traumatized by the deaths of his parents, would never be the same again. Afterward, Bruce was raised by his wise and loyal butler, <a href="../../alfred/29-5556/" rel="nofollow">Alfred Pennyworth</a>, and inherited his family's vast fortune as well as his father's company, Wayne Enterprises. Standing at his parents' gravestones, Bruce made a solemn oath to avenge their deaths.</p><p>Despite fiscal security, happiness eluded Bruce. Young Bruce was comforted by <a href="../../leslie-thompkins/29-3740/" rel="nofollow">Dr. Leslie Thompkins</a>, who helped him to mourn his parents and find a purpose in life. At age fourteen, Bruce started a twelve year walkabout around the world seeking experts in many fields, training himself mentally and physically. From an academic standpoint, he studied at Cambridge in <a href="/england/4020-55794/" data-ref-id="4020-55794">England</a>, the Sorbonne in <a href="/france/4020-55778/" data-ref-id="4020-55778">France,</a> and other famous European universities.

But despite all his honed skills, he knew something was missing. Bruce believed criminals to be a "superstitious and cowardly lot," and in order to rid <a href="/gotham-city/4020-23611/" data-ref-id="4020-23611">Gotham</a> of evil, he needed to reinvent himself to become a terrifying symbol that would strike fear into the hearts of criminals. While in his <a href="/thomas-wayne/4005-3602/" data-ref-id="4005-3602">father</a>'s study, a large bat crashed through the window. Bruce saw this as an omen and recalled his fear of bats as a child. This would be his symbol; the Bat would strike terror into the Gotham underworld. Using his vast wealth, Bruce designed a costume and state of the art equipment, thus beginning a difficult double life: by day, he would be the billionaire playboy and businessman, Bruce Wayne, and by night, he was The Batman.</p><h2><strong>Creation</strong></h2><figure data-ref-id="1300-2890907" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/138572/2890907-Originalbatman.jpg" data-size="medium" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.0134529147982" data-width="223" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 223px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:101.3%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/138572/2890907-Originalbatman.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2890907"><img alt="Bob Kane's original design." src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/138572/2890907-Originalbatman.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/138572/2890907-Originalbatman.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" data-width="223"></a><figcaption>Bob Kane's original design.</figcaption></figure><p>Batman, one of the most influential comic book characters to be penned, was created by artist <a href="../../bob-kane/26-19137/" rel="nofollow">Bob Kane</a> and writer <a href="../../bill-finger/26-43591/" rel="nofollow">Bill Finger</a>, though Kane, who designed the character, often receives credit as the sole creator. After the success of <a href="/superman/4005-1807/" data-ref-id="4005-1807">Superman</a> in early 1939, <a href="/dc-comics/4010-10/" data-ref-id="4010-10">DC comics</a> started requesting more superheroes for its titles. Bob Kane had an idea for a character called "Bat-Man." There is a large controversy that suggests Kane came up with a "Birdman" and Finger is the one who actually suggested the name "Bat-man." The character's alter-ego's name was influenced by the names of the Scottish patriot Robert the Bruce and revolutionary U.S. Brigadier General Mad Anthony Wayne (who, in the comics, is an ancestor of Bruce). For the character's costume, <a href="/bob-kane/4040-19137/" data-ref-id="4040-19137">Kane</a> drew inspiration from a flying device designed by Leonardo da Vinci: the ornithopter, a glider that had bat like wings.</p><p>Most of the Bat costume designs were suggested by <a href="/bill-finger/4040-43591/" data-ref-id="4040-43591">Bill Finger</a>. Kane initially drew Batman with a red and black costume, a domino mask, and wings. Finger suggested the character's costume be colored gray &amp; black to make the character look more "ominous." He also suggested replacing the domino mask with a cowl and the wings with a cape. Finger also wanted Kane to change the way Batman's eyes appeared behind the mask and urged him to turn them into white spots. Later Finger admitted that he was influenced by the comic character <a href="../../the-phantom/29-7957/" rel="nofollow">The Phantom</a>, who also wore a mask with no visible pupils. Gloves were also added so that Batman would not leave fingerprints behind.</p><figure data-ref-id="1300-2047033" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2047033-detective_comics_super.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.385" data-width="400" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 400px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:138.5%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2047033-detective_comics_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2047033"><img alt="Batman's First appearance" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" data-width="462" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2047033-detective_comics_super.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2047033-detective_comics_super.jpg 400w"><noscript><img alt="Batman's First appearance" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2047033-detective_comics_super.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2047033-detective_comics_super.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" data-width="462"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman's First appearance</figcaption></figure><p>Like <a href="/superman/4005-1807/" data-ref-id="4005-1807">Superman</a>, various aspects of Batman's personality, character history, visual design and equipment were inspired by contemporary popular culture of the 1930's, including movies, pulp magazine, comic strips, newspaper headlines and even aspects of Kane himself. Notable sources of inspiration were two of Kane's favorite movies, The Bat Whispers (1930), the film was a screen adaptation of Mary Robert Rinehart's mystery novel that featured character named The Bat, a detective who has a secret alter ego known as the Bat. The other movie that influenced Kane was The Mark of Zorro (1920). One might point out that in the movies young Bruce Wayne is often shown to have seen a <a href="../../zorro/29-15896/" rel="nofollow">Zorro</a> movie before his parents were murdered. The character first appeared in <a href="../../detective-comics-the-case-of-the-chemical-syndicate/37-105764/" rel="nofollow">Detective Comics #27</a>, published in 1939, and later became popular enough to spawn his own comics. Along with <a href="../../superman/29-1807/" rel="nofollow">Superman</a> and <a href="../../wonder-woman/29-2048/" rel="nofollow">Wonder Woman</a>, Batman has provided many of the core story arcs for the DC brand since his creation.</p><p>Batman is unique for the simple reason that he has no superhuman powers and is an ordinary human relying on intelligence, money, inventiveness, detective skills, martial arts, and fear to defeat his opponents. He currently makes the most money for a single publishing character and is widely considered to be one of the most popular superheroes in all of comics.</p><p>In the original version of the story and the vast majority of re-tellings, Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, an American millionaire (later billionaire) playboy, industrialist, and philanthropist. Having witnessed the murder of his parents as a child, he swore revenge on criminals, an oath tempered with the greater ideal of justice. Wayne trains himself both physically and intellectually and dons a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the fictional American Gotham City, assisted by various supporting characters including his crime-fighting partner, Robin, his butler Alfred Pennyworth, the police commissioner Jim Gordon, and occasionally the heroine Batgirl. He fights an assortment of villains such as the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, Ra's al Ghul,Scarecrow, Poison Ivy, and Catwoman, among others. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, martial arts skills, an indomitable will, fear, and intimidation in his continuous war on crime.</p><p>Batman became a very popular character soon after his introduction and gained his own comic book title, Batman, in 1940. As the decades wore on, differing interpretations of the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series used a camp aesthetic which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, with varying results. The comic books of this dark stage culminated in the acclaimed 1986 miniseries The Dark Knight Returns, by Frank Miller, as well as Batman: The Killing Joke by Alan Moore and Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, among others. The overall success of Warner Bros.' live-action Batman feature films have also helped maintain public interest in the character.</p><h3><strong><ins>Pulp Influences</ins></strong></h3><p>Batman as a character was heavily influenced by Pulp magazines, cheaply-printed prose magazines that were a popular form of mass entertainment in the first half of twentieth century. Pulp genres varied from romance to horror, but mysterious heroes featured heavily. And as Bill Finger later said, Batman was originally written in pulp style. One famous Pulp character that inspired both Finger and Kane - in different medias - was <a href="../../the-shadow/29-28923/" rel="nofollow">The Shadow</a>. Finger liked the magazine version of the character: a gun toting no nonsense crime fighter whose real identity was a mystery. Kane preferred the radio version of The Shadow: a wealthy playboy named Lamont Cranston who had the hypnotic power "to cloud men's minds," to prevent them from seeing him.</p><h2><strong>Character Evolution</strong></h2><h3><strong><ins>Golden Age</ins></strong></h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-2317812" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2317812-114472_76468_batman_super.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.11" data-width="400" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 400px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:111.0%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2317812-114472_76468_batman_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2317812"><img alt="Golden Age Batman" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" data-width="576" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2317812-114472_76468_batman_super.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2317812-114472_76468_batman_super.jpg 400w"><noscript><img alt="Golden Age Batman" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2317812-114472_76468_batman_super.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2317812-114472_76468_batman_super.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" data-width="576"></noscript></a><figcaption>Golden Age Batman</figcaption></figure><p>During the <a href="../../golden-age-of-comics/12-55820/" rel="nofollow">Golden Age of Comics</a>, when he was first introduced, Bruce Wayne was already the vigilante known as Batman. Batman's first appearance was in <a href="/millennium-edition-detective-comics-27/4050-32756/" data-ref-id="4050-32756">Detective Comics #27</a>. In <a href="../../detective-comics-/37-112065/" rel="nofollow">Detective Comics #33</a>, the origin of the character was told. Bruce Wayne was the son of <a href="../../thomas-wayne/29-3602/" rel="nofollow">Thomas Wayne</a> and his wife, <a href="../../martha-wayne/29-3603/" rel="nofollow">Martha Wayne</a>. His parents were wealthy philanthropists in the high society of <a href="../../gotham-city/34-23611/" rel="nofollow">Gotham City</a>. Bruce grew up in <a href="../../wayne-manor/34-55767/" rel="nofollow">Wayne Manor</a> and experienced a privileged life until one fateful night. Bruce and his parents went to the movies and were walking home when suddenly they were confronted by a small-time crook carrying a gun named <a href="../../joe-chill/29-32672/" rel="nofollow">Joe Chill</a>. At first, Chill demanded <a href="/martha-wayne/4005-3603/" data-ref-id="4005-3603">Martha</a>'s jewellery, but he ended up shooting both of Bruce’s parents. After the deaths of his parents, Bruce swore to rid <a href="../../gotham-city/34-23611/" rel="nofollow">Gotham City</a> of evil forever. He began an intense mental and physical training and mastered many skills including martial arts, criminology, and escape artistry.</p><p>Upon completing his training Bruce realized that his skills alone were not enough to do the job; he needed the criminals to fear him. That was when a bat flew through the window, scaring Bruce. He was inspired by the symbolism of the bat and used this to become Batman. Batman witnesses the death of the <a href="/flying-graysons/4060-55863/" data-ref-id="4060-55863">Flying Graysons</a>, high-flying acrobats that were killed by mobsters after the owner of the circus refused to pay "protection money" for the crooks to be their bodyguards. Bruce takes in young <a href="../../dick-grayson/29-1691/" rel="nofollow">Dick Grayson</a> as his ward and trains him as his sidekick, <a href="../../robin/29-1687/" rel="nofollow">Robin</a>. Bruce and <a href="/dick-grayson/4005-1691/" data-ref-id="4005-1691">Dick</a> first hunt down and defeat <a href="/anthony-zucco/4005-22815/" data-ref-id="4005-22815">Tony Zucco</a>, the crime boss that was responsible for the deaths of <a href="/john-grayson/4005-6844/" data-ref-id="4005-6844">John</a> and <a href="/mary-grayson/4005-38117/" data-ref-id="4005-38117">Mary Grayson</a>. It is never stated why Bruce took in <a href="../../dick-grayson/29-1691/" rel="nofollow">Dick</a>, but it could be due to how <a href="../../dick-grayson/29-1691/" rel="nofollow">Dick</a> lost his parents at a young age just like Bruce. Together the " <a href="../../the-dynamic-duo/65-56496/" rel="nofollow">Dynamic Duo</a>" face off against many enemies such as the <a href="../../riddler/29-3718/" rel="nofollow">Riddler</a>, <a href="../../scarecrow/29-3726/" rel="nofollow">Scarecrow</a>, <a href="../../penguin/29-4885/" rel="nofollow">Penguin</a> and the <a href="../../joker/29-1702/" rel="nofollow">Joker</a>.</p><p>Batman eventually becomes one of the founding members of the <a href="../../justice-society-of-america/65-27589/" rel="nofollow">Justice Society Of America</a>. Batman continued working with the <a href="../../gotham-city-police-department/65-42090/" rel="nofollow">Gotham City Police Department</a> in fighting crime and is later legally deputized as a civilian police agent. Later <a href="../../alfred/29-5556/" rel="nofollow">Alfred Pennyworth</a> is introduced and serves as his butler. Alfred eventually learns the identities of the Dynamic Duo and aids them in keeping their identity safe. Love interest <a href="../../vicki-vale/29-8264/" rel="nofollow">Vicki Vale</a> debuted during the 1940's as one of the numerous "flavors of the month" for Bruce Wayne. Vicki was created as a mirror of <a href="../../lois-lane/29-1808/" rel="nofollow">Lois Lane</a> of <a href="../../metropolis/34-41184/" rel="nofollow">Metropolis</a>, and she often spent her time trying to figure out the identity of Batman. Whenever she got close to figuring out that Batman was Bruce Wayne, Batman would often trick her into believing he was <em><strong>not</strong></em> Bruce Wayne. (Secret identities nearly being found out was a common occurrence in the Golden Age.) Batman was first shown as a cold-blooded vigilante who was willing to use a gun and kill his enemies to rid the city of crime. But this revolted some readers, who made it clear that they <em><strong>hated</strong></em> the idea of their hero going around killing people. At the same time, DC Comics's new editor, Whitney Ellsworth, was already drafting, and eventually implemented, a moral code for Batman that prevented him from ever killing or using a gun.</p><h3><strong><ins>Silver Age</ins></strong></h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-2317813" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2317813-20100406012608_batman_silver_age_001.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.2790178571429" data-width="448" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 448px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:127.9%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2317813-20100406012608_batman_silver_age_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2317813"><img alt="Silver Age Batman" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-width="500" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2317813-20100406012608_batman_silver_age_001.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2317813-20100406012608_batman_silver_age_001.jpg 448w"><noscript><img alt="Silver Age Batman" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2317813-20100406012608_batman_silver_age_001.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2317813-20100406012608_batman_silver_age_001.jpg 448w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-width="500"></noscript></a><figcaption>Silver Age Batman</figcaption></figure><p>During the <a href="../../silver-age-of-comics/12-55821/" rel="nofollow">Silver Age</a> <a href="../../dc-comics/57-10/" rel="nofollow">DC Comics</a> introduced the <a href="../../the-dc-multiverse/12-43603/" rel="nofollow">Multiverse</a> continuity to its characters.

The Earth-Two Batman marries <a href="../../catwoman/29-1698/" rel="nofollow">Catwoman</a> and fathered a daughter named <a href="../../helena-wayne/29-45563/" rel="nofollow">Helena Wayne</a> who grows up to be the <a href="../../huntress/29-1690/" rel="nofollow">Huntress</a>. Earth-Two Batman retires to take the job as Commissioner of the GCPD. <a href="../../dick-grayson/29-1691/" rel="nofollow">Dick Grayson</a> of Earth-Two became a lawyer with his own practice and continued his career as the Earth-Two Robin. Eventually he dies during his final adventure against a criminal named <a href="/bill-jensen/4005-68702/" data-ref-id="4005-68702">Bill Jensen</a> who had acquired superpowers. Batman's back story was expanded upon to include his uncle, Philip Wayne, who raised Bruce for a while after his parents' deaths. He also had an older brother named <a href="../../thomas-wayne/29-3602/" rel="nofollow">Thomas Wayne</a> Jr. who had to be institutionalizes after the death of <a href="/thomas-wayne/4005-3602/" data-ref-id="4005-3602">Thomas</a> and <a href="/martha-wayne/4005-3603/" data-ref-id="4005-3603">Martha</a>. In addition, it was revealed that his parents' killing had not been chance, but an assassination ordered by gangster <a href="../../lew-moxon/29-18944/" rel="nofollow">Lew Moxon</a>.</p><p>As a child, Bruce's father had worn a bat costume (similar to Batman's future costume) to a masquerade party, where he encountered and stopped the mobster. <a href="/lew-moxon/4005-18944/" data-ref-id="4005-18944">Moxon</a> swore revenge against <a href="../../thomas-wayne/29-3602/" rel="nofollow">Dr. Wayne</a>, and hired <a href="/joe-chill/4005-32672/" data-ref-id="4005-32672">Joe Chill</a> to orchestrate the "mugging" that would result in their deaths. At some point in Bruce's training, he wears a costume similar to the future <a href="../../robin/29-1687/" rel="nofollow">Robin's</a> and is trained by <a href="../../harvey-harris/29-39614/" rel="nofollow">Harvey Harris</a>, a Gotham City Police detective. During this time Batman would regularly team up with other heroes to fight evil (these adventures were published in <a href="/worlds-finest-comics/4050-18006/" data-ref-id="4050-18006">World’s Finest Comics</a> from the 1950's through the 1980's), and many of the team-ups featured Batman, <a href="../../superman/29-1807/" rel="nofollow">Superman</a> and, occasionally, <a href="/dick-grayson/4005-1691/" data-ref-id="4005-1691">Robin</a> and led to the formation of the <a href="../../justice-league-of-america/65-31815/" rel="nofollow">Justice League of America</a>.</p><p>After <a href="../../nightwing/29-1691/" rel="nofollow">Robin</a> (Dick Grayson) sustains an injury, Batman insists on going without a sidekick. Dick leaves to attend college and moves out of Wayne Manor. Batman primarily works solo but occasionally teams up with <a href="/dick-grayson/4005-1691/" data-ref-id="4005-1691">Robin</a> and <a href="../../batgirl/29-1701/" rel="nofollow">Batgirl</a>. It was during this period where Batman starts becoming a bit darker (partly due to the loss of Robin's presence, but mainly because times were changing in the real world). Violent crimes increase in <a href="/gotham-city/4020-23611/" data-ref-id="4020-23611">Gotham</a> and the <a href="../../joker/29-1702/" rel="nofollow">Joker</a> returns with a darker, more sadistic nature (i.e. he was starting to kill his victims)</p><p>The Batman also comes face to face with <a href="../../ras-al-ghul/29-40816/" rel="nofollow">Ra's al Ghul</a>, the Demon's Head. Ra's has lived for over 600 years and is one of the few people who deduces that Bruce Wayne is Batman. Ra's saw their ideals as being the same, but the two became rivals quickly when Batman realized that Ra's did not value the lives of others as he did. During this time Bruce's older brother, Thomas Wayne, Jr., reappears. Thomas becomes an assassin, but his body was taken over by the anti-hero <a href="../../deadman/29-5690/" rel="nofollow">Deadman</a>. Batman was able to remove <a href="../../deadman/29-5690/" rel="nofollow">Deadman</a> from his brother's body, but Thomas soon dies trying to save his younger brother's life. Batman later quit the <a href="../../justice-league-of-america/65-31815/" rel="nofollow">Justice League</a> to form his new group called the <a href="../../outsiders/65-5704/" rel="nofollow">Outsiders</a>.

DC Comics attempted to reboot many major characters' origins including Batman. The re-tooled history was recounted in <a href="../../frank-miller/26-7082/" rel="nofollow">Frank Miller</a>’s run on the <a href="../../batman-year-one/39-42224/" rel="nofollow">Batman: Year One</a> story arc, or, at least the more serious, less campier sides of The Dark Knight. This made Batman darker and more believable and showed how much Batman dominates Bruce Wayne's psychology, so much so that Bruce has fully transformed into the Dark Knight, both physically and mentally. The character of <a href="/james-gordon/4005-3727/" data-ref-id="4005-3727">Jim Gordon</a> was portrayed in greater detail, and the corruption of the <a href="../../gotham-city-police-department/65-42090/" rel="nofollow">Gotham City Police Department</a> was more pronounced, giving more of a reason for <a href="../../gotham-city/34-23611/" rel="nofollow">Gotham City</a> to need Batman. <a href="../../dick-grayson/29-1691/" rel="nofollow">Dick</a>'s back story remains the same, but <a href="../../jason-todd/29-6849/" rel="nofollow">Jason Todd</a>'s origin was changed, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Philip Wayne and Thomas, Jr. were removed from continuity (up until the New 52 Relaunch where different versions of both characters returned) and Bruce was raised by his father's trusted friend and butler, <a href="../../alfred/29-5556/" rel="nofollow">Alfred Pennyworth</a>.</p><p>In addition, Batman was no longer a founding member of the Justice League. During the <a href="../../batman-son-of-the-demon/49-26065/" rel="nofollow">Son of the Demon</a> story arc, Batman marries <a href="../../talia/29-4917/" rel="nofollow">Talia</a>, and she becomes pregnant with their child. When Talia was attacked, Batman nearly dies trying to save her. Talia concludes that she was a hindrance to Batman and pretends to have a miscarriage. The two annulled their marriage, but Talia delivered the baby and gave him up.</p><p>Dick Grayson retires the Robin mantle to become Nightwing, and Batman replaces him with orphan Jason Todd to become the new Robin, but he ends up getting killed by the Joker. After losing Jason, Batman becomes self-destructive until Tim Drake enters his life and convinces him to make him the new Robin.</p><p>The 1994 company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as "Year Two" non-canon.</p><p>Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison's 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. Also under Morrison, it s revealed that Batman had a child with Talia Al Ghul known as Damian, who was raised to be a ruthless assassin by the age of three.</p><p>During the events of Final Crisis, Batman is apparently killed by Darkseid, and he is replaced by Dick Grayson as Batman who enlists Damian as Robin. It eventually revealed that Batman is alive and after his return, he forms Batman Incorporated, where he attempts to use the Batman mantle as an international force for good.</p><h3><strong><ins>The New 52</ins></strong></h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4293279-batman+91.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4293279" data-ratio="1.5164556962025" data-width="395" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 395px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:151.6%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4293279-batman+91.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4293279"><img alt="Batman's New 52 re-design" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4293279-batman+91.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4293279-batman+91.jpg 395w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4293279-batman+91.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="Batman's New 52 re-design" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4293279-batman+91.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4293279-batman+91.jpg 395w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4293279-batman+91.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman's New 52 re-design</figcaption></figure><p>With the New 52 relaunch, Batman retained a large part of his mythos but there were some changes. Batman has been active for around seven years, and is presently portrayed to be more tech-based. Catwoman no longer knows his secret identity, Grayson is back to being Nightwing, Tim Drake is now Red Robin and leader of the teen titans, Barbara Gordon is now Batgirl and Damian now operates as Bruce's sidekick. He is also a founding member of the Justice League, and acts as the team's leader. He first appeared during the event known as Zero Year when Gotham was taken over by the Riddler.</p><p>Years later he fought the Court of Owls, a group of criminals who have been controlling Gotham from behind the scenes for many years, and new character Harper Row is introduced as an ally. Also, a violent encounter with the now faceless Joker strained the relationship between the Batman Family. To make matters worse, Damian is later killed by the Heretic during Batman's war with Talia Al Ghul's terrorist organization Leviathan. Batman is consumed by depression and continues to alienate himself from his allies until he discovers a mystical shard that gave him the ability in the story to bring Damian back.</p><p>During the events of the weekly series called Batman Eternal, Gordon is framed or murder and Gotham plunges into chaos. Batman's home is turned into an Asylum after the destruction of Arkham, and Bruce loses all of his money after the criminal known as Hush takes over Batman's weapon bases and blows them up, killing many people. Batman is forced to rely on limited resources and ends up living in a penthouse, once belonging to the Court of Owls, in the middle of Gotham.</p><p>During Endgame, the Joker reveals the he knows Batman's secret identity, and orchestrates a plot that sees turn the citizens of Gotham into Joker-ized psychos. In that story, the Joker almost convinces Batman that he is immortal, but it is later revealed that the Joker discovered a substance that allowed him to heal from wounds. In their final battle under the bedrocks of Gotham near a pool of dinoseum, the entire cave collapses, and both men apparently die. Months later, Jim Gordon becomes the new Batman and dons a robotic suit, operating within the law. But it is revealed that Bruce is alive but has lost all memory of his days as Batman, and is currently living a rather peaceful life with Julie Madison.</p><h3><ins><strong>DC: </strong><strong>Rebirth</strong></ins></h3><h4> </h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5436234-9421608823-latest" data-ref-id="1300-5436234" data-ratio="1.7215081405313" data-width="1167" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1167px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:172.2%" href="https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5436234-9421608823-latest" data-ref-id="1300-5436234"><img alt="Batman's Rebirth re-design" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" data-width="371" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111283887/5436234-9421608823-latest" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5436234-9421608823-latest 1167w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11128/111283887/5436234-9421608823-latest 1115w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111283887/5436234-9421608823-latest 557w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111283887/5436234-9421608823-latest 371w"><noscript><img alt="Batman's Rebirth re-design" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111283887/5436234-9421608823-latest" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5436234-9421608823-latest 1167w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11128/111283887/5436234-9421608823-latest 1115w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111283887/5436234-9421608823-latest 557w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111283887/5436234-9421608823-latest 371w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" data-width="371"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman's Rebirth re-design</figcaption></figure><p>The launch of DC Rebirth intends to reestablish the universe as it was prior to the events of Flashpoint while incorporating elements from the New 52.

While Batman was tracking down the killer, the Joker himself appears on live TV, on a news report on Arkham Asylum, killing the reporter with his mysterious laughing venom and predicting the deaths of some of the richest individuals in Gotham. Bruce wonders whether the Joker is a deformed version of the Red Hood, a criminal who fell into chemical waste while being engaged by Batman. The Joker carries out his hits as promised, using his venom, despite Batman's efforts to stop him. The city is thrown into chaos when he invades a prison facility and sets its inmates free, providing them with weapons and killing all of its guard personnel in the process. The criminals wreak great havoc throughout the city but are apprehended by Batman. Joker's next target is Bruce Wayne. Thus, Wayne Manor is under strict surveillance and guard by the police, making Bruce unable to act as Batman. He secretly injects himself with some Joker venom he had gathered. The venom takes instant effect and Bruce is rushed to the hospital. But on the way, Alfred administers him with the antidote he had made after careful study and as Bruce recovers, he understands the Joker's true plan. He had gained an understanding of what drives the Joker while under the effects of the venom and realized Bruce Wayne's assassination is only a diversion from his real mission, which is killing everyone in Gotham by poisoning its water reservoir, which Batman deduces from the clues he had gained in the last few days while tracking the Joker. He finds and stops Joker at the reservoir and refrains from killing him, though not without giving him a severe beating. The Joker is put in the reopened Arkham Asylum.</p><h3><strong>The Long Halloween</strong></h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-4162090" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="0.74831460674157" data-width="890" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 890px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:74.8%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4162090"><img alt="Batman, Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg 890w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="Batman, Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg 890w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman, Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent</figcaption></figure><p>In Batman's early years, his main objective was to take down Gotham's biggest crime lord Carmine "The Roman" Falcone. To do this, Batman required the help of two of Gotham's finest, "hero cop" Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. Despite dealing massive blows to the criminal empire, the Roman still stood tall until a killer by the name of Holiday started making his move and killing a member of the Falcone Crime family on every occasion.</p><p> </p><p>Over the course of the story, the trio's morals are put into question, notably Dent's, who has let it be known that he does not care for the deaths of criminals and even contemplated stealing some of the weakened Roman's money. Jealous by the attention Holiday has received, the Joker attempts to release his gas on Gotham Square at New Year's Eve to kill everyone in attendance, and hopefully Holiday but he is stopped by Batman.</p><p>Later on, it is revealed that Dent was in possession of the same type of gun that was used in the Holiday murders, turning him into a prime suspect. Despite Gordon's suspicions, Batman refuses to believe that his friend, who shares his love for justice, would be a killer. On the Roman's birthday, Sal Maroni, Falcone's rival, is set to testify against Carmine, prosecuted by Dent. Just as things seemed to go Dent's way, Maroni ends up throwing acid in the attorney's face, physically and mentally scarring him. After being rushed to the hospital, Harvey escapes in a crazed state and kills a doctor. Gordon moves Maroni to a new cell, suspecting that he may be Holiday's next target.</p><p>Surely enough, Holiday makes his move and kills Maroni and just as he is about to kill Gordon, who was escorting the gangster, Batman appears just in time to save his friend and take down the killer, and he is revealed to be Falcone's son, Alberto, who holds a grudge against his father for neglecting him and keeping him out of the family business. A while later, Dent makes his return, with half his face disfigured, now calling himself Two-Face. He regroups all the costume freaks including Joker, Scarecrow and Poison Ivy, among others and bursts into the disgraced Roman's penthouse to signify the change that has come to Gotham. Batman appears and takes down the villains with the exception of Dent who holds Falcone hostage. Despite Batman's pleads, Two-Face ends up killing Falcone and then surrenders himself. In the end, when confronted by Batman and Gordon, Dent claims that his methods were the most effective in taking down Falcone. Despite witnessing the corruption of their friend, Batman and Gordon's resolve remains strong and they both vow to never give up on ridding Gotham of evil.</p><h3><strong>Dark Victory and Robin</strong></h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-4162088" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.5886666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1500px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:158.9%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4162088"><img alt="Batman &amp; Robin - The Dynamic Duo" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg 1500w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="Batman &amp; Robin - The Dynamic Duo" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg 1500w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman &amp; Robin - The Dynamic Duo</figcaption></figure><p>In the aftermath of the Roman's death, Falcone's daughter, Sofia Gigante has taken over the family business and vows to kill Two-Face who managed to escape from Arkham Asylum. Meanwhile, a killer by the name of Hangman has been killing various cops and implying that Two-Face is responsible. A gang war erupts between the crime families and the costumed freaks, recruited by Two-Face, and in the crossfire, circus acrobats, the Flying Graysons are killed by Falcone associate, Tony Zucco, leaving the performers' son, Dick, an orphan. Feeling sympathy for the child and remembering his own trauma, Bruce Wayne adopts Dick as his son. However, since Bruce was too busy trying to stop the war as Batman, Dick would often sneak out at night looking for his parent's killer. A terrified Tony Zucco, who knows that Batman is looking for him, is confronted by Dick and due to his poor health, ends up dying of a heart attack. Realizing the boy's vigilante tendencies, Bruce reveals his identity and decides to train him in order to avoid his death. It is later revealed that Hangman is actually Sofia Gigante and sets Gotham on fire to bring Dent out of hiding but before she could kill him, Batman saves him, giving Dent the opportunity to kill her and escape into the sewers with the rest of the super-villains with Batman in pursuit. In the climatic battle, Two-Face and his villainous group find themselves in the bat-cave but Dick's presence prevented them from discovering Batman's secret. Batman and Dick end up fighting off and defeating the villains once and for all. In the end, Batman offers Dick a chance to live a normal life away from vigilantism, but Dick insists on joining his war, and so, he becomes Robin, assisting Batman in his mission, and thus the Dynamic Duo was born.</p><h3><strong>Tales of the Ghul</strong></h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-4162092" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4162092-smooch.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.4853228962818" data-width="511" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 511px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:148.5%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4162092-smooch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4162092"><img alt="Batman passes Ra's Al Ghul's test" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" data-width="430" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4162092-smooch.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4162092-smooch.png 511w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4162092-smooch.jpg 430w"><noscript><img alt="Batman passes Ra's Al Ghul's test" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4162092-smooch.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4162092-smooch.png 511w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4162092-smooch.jpg 430w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" data-width="430"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman passes Ra's Al Ghul's test</figcaption></figure><p>While trying to stop the criminal Doctor Darrk, who was leading the League of Assassins at the time, Batman meets the enigmatic Talia Al Ghul, who was kidnapped by Darrk in an attempt to blackmail her father, the wealthy Ra's Al Ghul.

One night, Batman discovers that Robin has been kidnapped and then, Ra's Al Ghul, who has used his immense resources to discover Batman's secret identity, appears to him in the Bat-Cave to ask for his help, as his daughter has also been kidnapped, possibly by the same person who kidnapped Robin. The two work together and, accompanied by Ra's' faithful bodyguard Ubu, travel the world looking for the kidnapper. Batman solves various puzzles and obstacles thrown in his path, and after finding both Talia and Robin, he deduces that Ra's was behind the entire ordeal as a personnel test, which Ra's declares he has passed. Ra's reveals that he wants to change the world into a better place, but to that, he wants to eradicate most of mankind. However, he is growing old and reveals that this machination took place because he was in need of a successor, and Batman has proven himself worthy of that position as well as the affections of his only daughter, Talia.

On the anniversary of his parents' death, Batman, as is his tradition, keeps watch over Crime Alley, the site of that tragic night. However, on his way back to the Batmobile, he finds a young street orphan by the name of Jason Todd attempting to steal the tires of the car. Though impressed by the kid's courage, he decides to take him to a school for the homeless, but when it is revealed that the school housed criminals, Batman, with Jason's help, takes it down. With nowhere for Jason to go and at the risk of him becoming another criminal on the streets, Batman decides to take Jason in as his own son, and seeing his potential to be a hero and also partly due to the loneliness he experienced after Dick Grayson's departure, offers Jason the mantle of Robin, which Jason gladly accepts. Batman later discovers that Jason's mother died of an overdose and his father was a reluctant partner of Two-Face, who ended up getting killed by the criminal. Although, Batman attempted to hide this from Robin, fearing what he may do, his faith in Jason is restored when Robin, having discovered Two-Face's acts, spared him even though he had the chance avenge his father's death.

His conduct on the field was in stark contrast to that of Batman's cold professionalism. Jason would often thrust himself into exceedingly dangerous situations, endangering both student and mentor, giving vent to his inner emotions, which seemed to be dominated by rage. This became even more evident when Jason seemingly killed a serial rapist who had walked free after causing the death of one of his victims. Batman soon realized Robin hadn't coped with the death of his parents, and felt it was best to make him inactive.</p><p>Back at his birth place in Crime Alley, Jason finds his birth certificate and learns that his mother wasn't the late Catherine Todd, but that there are three women who could be his mother, and all there are out of the country, so he left off in search of the first one, in the Middle East where he coincidentally meets up with Batman who was there tracking down the Joker.

Bruce leaves Jason to spend time with his mother while he chases after the Joker, but it is later revealed that Sheila was being blackmailed by the Joker into giving him shipments of medical supplies that he can sell in the black market while transferring his deadly Joker gas to relief destinations. Batman orders Jason to stay put while he chases the Joker, but Jason defies Batman's orders and leaves for the warehouse to find his mother. Jason manages to find her and reveals his secret identity to her, but she turns him over to the Joker in an attempt to save her own life. Joker savagely beats Jason with a crowbar, then detonates an explosive that kills both Jason and his mother.</p><p>Batman arrives just as the explosion goes off, and as he searches through the rubble, he finds, to his horror, the lifeless corpse of Jason. Batman grieves over the horrible site and vows to avenge Jason's death and take down the Joker once and for all. Batman vengefully tracks down the Joker, and though he manages stop his latest death plot, the madman escapes, ending this counter the same way as others, unresolved. Batman continues grieving over Jason's death, considering it to be his greatest failure and vows to never endanger anyone else in this line of work. Since then, he keeps Jason's costume in a glass casing in the Bat-Cave as a memorial, underneath it reads "A Good Soldier".</p><p><strong>A Lonely Place of Dying</strong></p><figure data-ref-id="1300-4165338" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4165338-tim32.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.4990619136961" data-width="533" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 533px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:149.9%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4165338-tim32.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4165338"><img alt="Tim Drake the new Robin" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4165338-tim32.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4165338-tim32.jpg 533w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4165338-tim32.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="Tim Drake the new Robin" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4165338-tim32.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4165338-tim32.jpg 533w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4165338-tim32.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tim Drake the new Robin</figcaption></figure><p>After Jason's tragic death, Batman became more violent and almost self-destructing when he battled crime. Tim Drake, a young boy who witnessed the death of the Graysons, noticed the dark nature of the Batman after the loss of Robin. Tim once idolized the Flying Graysons, and was in attendance when Dick's parents were killed. He also idolized Batman and Robin, as he saw them as heroes. Tim was able to deduce that Dick Grayson was in fact Robin when he noticed the costumed fighter perform an acrobatic move that only Dick could do, and knowing that the former acrobat was adopted by Bruce Wayne, he pieced things together and deduced that the millionaire is indeed Batman. He had figured out that the original Robin was Dick Grayson and thus, Bruce Wayne had to be Batman. Tim knew that Batman needed an ally in his war and after being unsuccessful in convincing Dick to return to the role, Dick petitions Bruce to train Tim to become the next Robin, in order to keep Batman sane, but Batman refuses, vowing to never endanger anyone but himself in his war on crime. Meanwhile Two-Face is on the loose and has prepared a plot to kill Batman once and for all, and this would have happened if not for the timely intervention of Tim Drake, wearing the Robin costume with Alfred's blessing and providing the necessary distraction for Batman to defeat his foe. In the end, both Alfred and Nightwing insist that the boy is capable of doing much good, especially under the guidance of Batman, and after much reluctance, Batman ends up agreeing. After a grueling training regime, Tim finally becomes the new Robin.</p><h3><strong>Knightfall</strong></h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-4165396" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="0.67666666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 600px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:67.7%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4165396"><img alt="Batman meets Bane" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg 600w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="Batman meets Bane" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg 600w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman meets Bane</figcaption></figure><p>After a long time of hard work, Batman and Robin finally succeed in placing all of the worst villains in Arkham Asylum, and thus apparently ensuring peace for Gotham. At one point he also encounters Jean-Paul Valley who is called Azrael, a victim of "The System" who was brainwashed into becoming an assassin for the sinister order known as The Order of Dumas, but Batman comforts Valley and takes him in as an ally to fight crime alongside him and reject his previous life. Just when it seemed that Gotham was at peace, a new villain makes his way to Gotham seeking to conquer it and defeat its guardian, the Batman. The villain, known only as Bane, destroys the walls of Arkham and frees every single inmate to rage havoc on the city. Batman, who was also sick at the time, is forced to run a gauntlet of his worst enemies, putting both his body and mind to the test. After a series of plots and encounters that weigh heavily on him, mentally and physically, fighting the likes of the Mad Hatter, the Ventriloquist, Amygdala, Victor Zsasz, Firefly, Riddler, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, Scarecrow, Joker and Two-Face, as well as encountering Bane's henchmen Zombie, Trogg and Bird, Batman finally manages to put them all back in prison however still oblivious to the mastermind behind this Gauntlet.</p><figure data-ref-id="1300-4165427" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4165427-bane_breaks_batman.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.5066666666667" data-width="300" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:150.7%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4165427-bane_breaks_batman.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4165427"><img alt="Broken by Bane" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-width="300" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4165427-bane_breaks_batman.png" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4165427-bane_breaks_batman.png 300w"><noscript><img alt="Broken by Bane" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4165427-bane_breaks_batman.png" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4165427-bane_breaks_batman.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-width="300"></noscript></a><figcaption>Broken by Bane</figcaption></figure><p>Batman finally returns home to rest only to be confronted by Bane, whose plan has come full circle and has come to Gotham to conquer it and defeat its protector. Though having almost no strength left, Batman accepts Bane's challenge and has one final fight. However, he is no match for this skilled foe, whose strength has also increased due to a drug known as Venom, and despite his best efforts Batman is horribly beaten and has his back broken by Bane in his own BatCave, paralyzing him. Bane throws Batman's body in the middle of a crowded street so that everyone sees the fall of the Dark Knight. Before his identity is compromised, Alfred and Robin quickly take him back to the manor to nurse him back to health. However, his will is just as broken as his body, as he realizes that he cannot don the costume again, and since Gotham needs a protector, he entrusts the mantle of Batman to Jean-Paul Valley and instructs a distraught Robin to be his ally.</p><h3><strong>Knightquest and Knightsend</strong></h3><p>After his paralysis, Batman is tended to by Shondra Kinsolving, a doctor whom Bruce met before and the two shared romantic feelings. However, one night, Shondra is kidnapped along with one of her patients, Jack Drake, Robin's father, and so, despite being in a wheelchair, Bruce, along with Alfred go after the kidnappers, and track them down to London, leaving Gotham under the care of Robin (who is oblivious to his father's kidnapping) and the new Batman. It is revealed in the story that Shondra had psychic powers, and was kidnapped by her brother Asp who intended to use those powers for his own gain. Bruce is caught in a telepathic exchange between Shondra and Asp, and the energy released causes Bruce to regain mobility of his legs. Now healed, he defeats Asp and saves Drake and Shondra, but the doctor's mental state was regressed to childhood due to the drugs given to her by her brother and she loses all memory of her relationship with Bruce. Preparing to get back into shape and regain his strength, Batman seeks the help of the skilled martial artist and assassin, Lady Shivam who agrees with the condition that he must kill. After several weeks of intense training, when it was time for Batman to kill, he refuses, causing Shiva to send various skilled assassins after him to force his hand. Bruce defeats the assassins and appears to kill the final one, much to Shiva's delight. However, he had used a technique that appeared to be lethal even though it was not. With his strength now regained, Batman is ready to come back to Gotham.</p><figure data-ref-id="1300-4165408" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.4406666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1500px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:144.1%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4165408"><img alt="Batman vs Batman" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg 1500w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg 666w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="Batman vs Batman" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg 1500w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg 666w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman vs Batman</figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, back in Gotham, Valley, now operating as Batman, attempts to track down Bane, who has now taken control of Gotham's underworld. However, Valley's brainwashing by the Order resurfaces, causing him to become more violent and to start losing control over his sanity. Donning a new tech heavy costume and refusing Robin as a partner, Valley becomes a far darker and much more violent Batman and eventually manages to defeat Bane and end his reign of terror. As the new Batman watches over Gotham, his vicious and reckless methods became intolerable by Robin, especially when he caused the deaths of the villain the Abattoir and his victims. When Robin tried to reason with him, Valley lashed out on him, almost killing him as he now considers himself to be superior to the real Batman. When Batman returns, having healed from his back injury, Jean-Paul tried to kill him to prove his superiority but Batman defeats and tricks him into removing his costume, thereby getting rid of "the system" in his head. Humbled and regretting his actions, Valley admits to Bruce that he (Bruce) is the one and only Batman and vows to redeem himself in his eyes. Though having regained the use of his legs, Batman decides to travel the world to fully regain his strength, and in his absence gives the mantle to the man he should have given it to in the first place, Nightwing, until he comes back.</p><h3><strong>No Man's Land</strong></h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-4165474" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4165474-batman-no-mans-land-1.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="400" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 400px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4165474-batman-no-mans-land-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4165474"><img alt="Batman watches his city in ruins" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4165474-batman-no-mans-land-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4165474-batman-no-mans-land-1.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4165474-batman-no-mans-land-1.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="Batman watches his city in ruins" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4165474-batman-no-mans-land-1.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4165474-batman-no-mans-land-1.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4165474-batman-no-mans-land-1.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman watches his city in ruins</figcaption></figure><p>Gotham is struck by a massive Earthquake, one which claims the lives of many people in Gotham. Batman had anticipated the arrival of an earthquake and had all Wayne-funded buildings be protected from such an event, including Oracle's Watchtower and Tim Drake's home, however, his own house did not receive such protection because that may compromise his identity as Batman. Bruce and Alfred barely survive the earthquake, and once out of the rubble, Batman watches in horror his city in ruins and there's nothing he could do about it. With most of the city destroyed, criminals run rampant around the remains and chaos ensues to the point where Gotham is declared a No Man's Land by the government and it is cut off from the rest of the country.

Others join the fight as well, including Oracle, who monitors the entire city and serves as information broker while Helena Bartinelli aka the Huntress, dons a Batman inspired costume to be more effective as a crime-fighter. Batman eventually returns and adapts to the new rules of Gotham, using spray paint to mark his territory and does everything he can to help his city. He allows Huntress to operate as Batgirl for a while until Two-Face's gang invades his territory and kill several people. Helena was forced to flee and when she refuses to follow Batman's orders anymore, he forces her to relinquish the Batgirl mantle.

After training her, he hands her a costume and she officially becomes the fourth Robin. Though initially there were some problems, especially when she used lethal force on the villain Mr. Zsasz, but she starts proving herself when she handily takes down Tiger Moth. Stephanie's infectious energy and enthusiasm grows on Batman and he starts to see her as a worthy partner. However, while tracking down the assassin Scarab, she disobeys Batman's order to stay put, and ends up getting herself held hostage and almost compromising the mission. Because of that, Batman ends her tenure as Robin. Determined to win back Batman's trust, Stephanie steals from the Bat-cave one of his contingency plans that was supposed to take place in case crime in Gotham got too out of control. The plan, which she put into motion behind Batman's back, dealt with unifying all the Gotham crime-families under one man, Matches Malone. What Stephanie didn't know was that Malone is actually one of Batman's underground alter-egos, and because Malone was not present at the staged meeting between crime-lords, things went awry and a huge gang war raged in Gotham, causing the deaths of many. Batman's reputation takes a major hit when he is seen by the media in broad day light holding the dead body of a young student who was killed in the crossfire of the gang war, and even more so when makes several morally questionable actions, including forcefully taking over command of the GCPD (which the results in the death of many), and attempting to put his underground ally, Orpheus, as the leader of all the gangs, but the Black Mask makes his move, kills Orpheus and becomes Gotham's kingpin of crime instead. Another consequence of this war was Stephanie Brown's death after intense torture at the hands of Black Mask. Batman was at her side in her last moments, and comforted her with the fact that she did earn her place as Robin.</p><h3><strong>Under the Red Hood</strong></h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-272033" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/272033-159917-jason-todd.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.5075" data-width="400" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 400px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:150.8%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/272033-159917-jason-todd.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-272033"><img alt="Batman vs Red Hood" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8190/272033-159917-jason-todd.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/272033-159917-jason-todd.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8190/272033-159917-jason-todd.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="Batman vs Red Hood" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8190/272033-159917-jason-todd.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/272033-159917-jason-todd.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8190/272033-159917-jason-todd.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman vs Red Hood</figcaption></figure><p>After the recent war, Batman has lot too much. Robin, Batgirl and Oracle have left Gotham City, Stephanie Brown is dead, Nightwing is injured, the GCPD sees Batman as a criminal and the Black Mask controls all crime in Gotham. However, a mysterious figure known as The Red Hood has been making his move on Black Mask's operations and taking control of his gangs. While intercepting one of Black Mask's shipments, Batman and Nightwing encounter Red Hood for the first time, and as they chase after him, they encounter the cyborg Amazo, which they barely manage to defeat. The Red Hood then steals another one of Mask's shipments tries to blackmail him, but the meeting turns sour with Freeze and Batman and Nightwing getting involved, and all the villains end up escaping. However, during the battle, Batman is intrigued by Red Hood's skills, as he sees something familiar.</p><p>While intercepting another one of Black Mask's operations, Red Hood is confronted by Batman where they fight to a stalemate. Red Hood finally takes off his mask and to Batman's horror, reveals that he is in fact, Jason Todd, the Robin who apparently died many years ago and even gives him samples of his DNA to prove it before escaping. It is revealed in the story that Jason came back after he was dipped in a Lazarus Pit by Talia Al ghul. After this revelation, Alfred offers to remove Jason's memorial from the Cave, but Batman refuses, claiming that the recent developments don't change anything.</p><p>After Red Hood blows up Black Mask's penthouse, the desperate crime lord seeks the help of Deathstroke of the Secret Society, who sends Hyena, Captain Nazi and Count Vertigo to kill the Red Hood. Batman intervenes and together they manage to take down the trio of super-villains, but not without Red Hood killing one of them and escaping.</p><p>After tricking Black Mask into killing the last of his lieutenants, Red Hood, who has been holding the Joker captive, challenges Batman to come to Crime Alley to end things once and for all. After apprehending Black Mask, Batman complies and meets up with Jason. After an intense back and forth fight, Batman defeats Jason and apologizes for failing him. Disgusted, Jason reveals that the reason he holds a grudge against Batman is because he never killed Joker to avenge his death. He then holds Joker hostage and throws Bruce a gun, and challenges him to make a choice: either kill Joker or kill him. Batman refuses both choices and ends up incapacitating Jason with a Batarang. An ecstatic Joker ends up blowing the entire place and in the aftermath, Jason manages to escape.</p><h3><strong>Infnite Crisis</strong></h3><p>Bruce also becomes more suspicious of other heroes, creating a super satellite called <a href="../../brother-eye/29-51483/" rel="nofollow">Brother Eye</a>, which is stolen and eventually causes the death of <a href="../../ted-kord/29-2054/" rel="nofollow">Ted Kord</a>.

Batman plays a key role in the relaunch, and one of the biggest changes in the universe is Bruce Wayne's return as Batman and <a href="../../dick-grayson/29-1691/" rel="nofollow">Dick Grayson</a>'s return as Nightwing.</p><p>Part of the New 52 relaunch involved a condensed timeline of the DC universe, which slightly affected Batman's origin story. However, unlike most characters, Batman has retained a certain amount of his Post-Crisis history, while some have been retold.</p><h3><strong>Early Life</strong></h3><p>Like his Post-Crisis counterpart, Bruce was born into the prestigious and wealthy Wayne family to surgeon and philanthropist Thomas Wayne, and social worker Martha Wayne of the Kane Family. When he was very young, Martha was expecting a second child, but after a mysterious car accident, was forced into premature labor and the baby died. After that, the family went on a vacation to forget that traumatic event, but the family butler, Jarvis Pennyworth was mysteriously killed, and his son, Alfred, a former actor and military medic, took his father's place as the butler, a position he continued to hold in Bruce's adult life. As a child, Bruce felt under pressure because of his family's reputation, and so he had a habit of sneaking out into the city and explore, to feel what it's like to be just like everyone else.</p><p>One night, Bruce and his parents went to the movies to watch The Mark Of Zorro, and on their way back, they were held at gunpoint by a mugger named Joe Chill, who attempted to take Martha's pearl necklace, but, in a state of panic, ended up shooting and killing both Thomas and Martha, leaving young Bruce traumatized by the event.</p><p>Bruce was convinced that his parents were the victims of a nefarious conspiracy, and made it his goal to find meaning to their deaths and apprehend their killer. After witnessing certain signs, Bruce started digging into the mythical Court of Owls, an old wives-tale about an underground society that secretly controlled Gotham, whom he thought were responsible for his parents' deaths, but in his search for clues, he had himself trapped in an abandoned warehouse for several days before he was found by Alfred. As he grow older, Bruce would constantly be haunted by this tragedy, often making him awkward among his teachers and classmates, and straining his relationship with his high school girlfriend, Julie Madison. Unable to cope with the pain, he had himself enlisted in Arkham Asylum in order to remove his memories using electro-shock therapy, but he was unable to go through with it and decided to use his pain as fuel. At the age of 18, he once again attempted to find his parents' killer, and started weightlifting and training in martial arts. He befriended his schoolmate Erin Mckillen, daughter of Irish Mobsters from the Mckillen Crime Family, and he used this friendship and her connections to track down Joe Chill. However, to his shock, he learns that there was no secret conspiracy, Chill was simply a poor, desperate man who needed money, and killed the Waynes out of panic. Bruce, crushed by this revelation, leaves Chill and decides to travel the word on a journey to train and vowed to fight and end crime in Gotham.</p><h3><strong>Traveling Around The World</strong></h3><p>At the age of nineteen, Bruce found himself in Rio De Janeiro, where he met a criminal by the name of Don Miguel who taught Bruce high speed driving and several insane driving tricks. In their final lesson, however, Bruce was instructed to lose the Policia in a bright red custom made convertible car and during an intense car chase, Miguel attempted to kill the cops using a dangerous weapon, but Bruce, having learned everything he needed from the criminal and wanting to prevent him from causing anymore damage, crashes the car, trapping Miguel before finally knocking him out and leaving him to be apprehended by the authorities.</p><p>At the age of twenty one, in Egypt, Bruce seeks out an old Russian scientist named Sergei to teach him what they call the impossible. Sergei challenges Bruce to a test by trapping him under the Sphinx, where he has limited supplies and oxygen. Bruce spends six months preparing for this test, tinkering with tools and planning for every scenario in order to survive, but Sergei tells him that he needs to go beyond planning and what is called possible in order to survive. Indeed, once Bruce is actually trapped, most of his preparations weren't operational and he was forced to improvise and go beyond what he thought was possible in order to escape and he manages to pass Sergei's test.</p><p>At the age of twenty four, Bruce found himself in the middle of a pit in the Northeast of Harstad, Norway, fighting for twenty-eight hours straight in a death match, defeating every fighter to challenge him but avoided killing anyone despite the insistence of the Pit Queen. Bruce came to this pit seeking to use his body to wage war, but the Queen claims that he cannot win this war without killing, and he will continue to fight until he dies. However, Bruce persists, winning battle after battle but without killing anyone, and in the end, there were no more fighters to challenge him because they were all afraid of him.</p><p>At one point, Bruce travelled to France seeking out famed manhunter Henri Ducard, in order to learn stealth and tracking. Impressed by the fact that Bruce was capable of finding him and son, Morgan, Ducard agreed to take him under his wing. Bruce would learn a lot from Ducard, while also developing a rivalry with Morgan, but when Bruce discovers, that the Ducards were also mercenaries and would kill their targets, Bruce cuts all ties from them. Henri orders Morgan to kill Bruce, an attempt that fails, and a vengeful Bruce beats down Morgan in a fit of rage, almost killing him.</p><p>Towards the end of his training, Bruce travels to the Himalayas to train with Shihan Matsuda where he learned swordsmanship, healing and meditation. During his stay, he develops feelings for a young woman named Mio and though he was warned by Shihan to avoid personal ties, those feelings caused Bruce to inadvertently allow an assassin, hired by Matsuda's wife, into the household and attack and gravely injure Mio and the Matsudas. Though Bruce managed to fight him off, Shihan's injuries were fatal and before he died, he warned Bruce to avoid personal relationships or they will have him killed. Bruce took this lesson to heart, as he decides to cut himself off from everyone, and so, after four years of travels, Bruce returns to Gotham.</p><h3><strong>Return to Gotham</strong></h3><p>Back in Gotham, with nothing but his war on crime on his mind, and no regard for his legacy as a Wayne, Bruce sets up a secret headquarters in an old brownstone in Park Row where he is joined by his faithful butler Alfred, who disapproves of this whole endeavor. One of his first missions deals with taking down The Red Hood Gang, a group of criminals who endorse random violence. However, he has been having a hard time winning his war due to his inexperience, carelessness and uncontrolled anger. In Bruce's absence from Gotham, his Uncle, Philipe Kane, who had declared Bruce legally dead while keeping tabs on him, has taken control of Wayne Enterprises and is using it to produce weapons. In an attempt to improve the company's public image, Philip attempts to convince Bruce to take control of his family's company, but Bruce refuses, as has no interest in living as "Bruce Wayne".</p><p>To make matters worse, the Red Hood gang is stealing the weapons produced by the company to further terrorize the city. Phil's leading strategist, Edward Nygma, advises Phil to kill Bruce in order to solve their problems but Philip refuses and still tries to convince Bruce to lead the company.</p><p>However, following a surprise party for Bruce by his uncle, the Red Hood Gang, thanks to a tip from Nygma, ambush Bruce and give him a vicious beating. Bruce barely survives, and manages to makes it back to the manor where he is nursed back to health by Alfred. Enraged by Nygma's actions, Philip attempts to kill the villain, admitting that Bruce is a better man than both of them, but Nygma incapacitates Philip and ends their alliance.</p><p>Bruce comes to terms with the fact that he is losing this war and asks his father for guidance. Then a bat crashes through his window, and Bruce finally decides that he will become a Bat.</p><h3><strong>Becoming Batman</strong></h3><p>Finally realizing his purpose, Bruce and Alfred set up their base in a cave under Wayne Manor, and Bruce sets off to strike fear in the hearts of criminals as Batman. He starts by methodically taking out members of the Red Hood gang, quickly establishing his reputation and finally getting the attention of Red Hood One, the gang's leader. While investigating the gang's operations, eventually, with some help from a guilt ridden Phillip, who was forced into becoming a member of the gang, Bruce discovers that the Red Hood gang are planning to use dangerous toxins from the Ace Chemical factory to terrorize the city. He holds a press conference in front of the factory and exposes the gang's plans, forcing them to invade the factory right away. As Batman, Bruce fights off the Red Hood gang, but not without the death of Uncle Philip, who was killed by the leader for attempting to stop him. As the GCPD round up members of the gang, the factory burns down and Batman goes after the leader, preventing him from escaping and defeating him, but despite Bruce's efforts to save him, the Red Hood allows himself to fall into a large acid container.</p><p>In the aftermath, Batman continues setting up his Bat-Cave and establishing himself as a hero in Gotham. Edward Nygma, now calling himself The Riddler, makes his presence known and knocks out all power from the city, in an attempt to challenge the people to get smarter.</p><h3><strong>The Zero Year</strong></h3><p>Following Riddler's blackout, a huge storm hits and the city plunges into chaos. To make matters worse, Batman, now declared a fugitive by Commissioner Loeb, investigate a series of gruesome murders committed by a disgruntled WaynTech employee, Dr. Helfern, who had injected himself with a dangerous formula, turning himself into the terrifying Dr. Death. As Bruce continues his investigation, he seeks the help of Lucius Fox, an old friend of his father's and engineer who used to work for WayneTech. However, both are attacked and almost killed by Dr. Death had it not for the timely intervention of Officer Jim Gordon. Realizing that Dr. Death is more than he can handle on his own, Batman begrudgingly teams with Gordon, as Bruce had once thought to have witnessed Jim receive a bribe (though that was not the case) years ago and he sees him as nothing more than a corrupt cop. They split up and discover that Helfern is Riddler's pawn as part of Riddler's plan to take over the city's power grid. Despite both men's valiant efforts, including a violent face off between Batman and Dr. Death over Gotham Harbor, Riddler's plan works, as the power returns to the city, but under Riddler's control.</p><p>In the following months, known as The Zero Year, the city's vegetation overgrows, and it falls into ruin, turning it into a "Savage City", with Riddler operating as the City's ruler, challenging the people to best him in a riddle in order to prove their intellectual worth and win back their city. Having recovered from his battle with Helfern, Bruce teams up with Gordon and Lucius Fox in an elaborate plan to determine his location and take him down, where Batman even attempts to take on Riddler's riddle challenge himself. In the end, Batman manages to locate Riddler, but not before the villain arranges an airstrike against the city and challenges Batman to solve his riddles in order to stop it. Though Batman is successful and defeats him, Riddler gives him one final test, which involves sending a current of electricity through a device that sends the signal that calls off the airstrike, but the device is attached to Riddler's heart, so that would kill him. Batman knocks out Riddler and uses the device on himself, thus stopping the air-strike, but stopping his own heart as well had it not for the timely intervention of Alfred, who resuscitated him. With Riddler defeated, thanks to the efforts of Gordon and Fox, power to the city returns.</p><p>In the aftermath, Nygma is placed in Arkham Asylum, Gordon becomes the new Police Commissioner, and Bruce embraces his legacy as a Wayne, and with Lucius Fox, re-builds Wayne Enterprises and restores its good name. Bruce is paid a visit by his old flame, Julie Madison, giving him a chance at a happy life, but, despite Alfred's insistence, Bruce instead chooses to live his life as Gotham's Guardian, The Batman.</p><h3><strong>Early Adventures</strong></h3><p>As Batman's legend grew, so did his Rogues' Gallery, and in these days, Batman has many adventures with some being loose adaptations of Post-Crisis stories while others being complete retellings. In The Joker's first appearance, not unlike his Pre-New 52 version, he announced plans to kill several key figures and attempted to poison Gotham's Reservoir, which Batman managed to stop. Batman's history with Ra's Al Ghul and his daughter Talia have mostly remained intact, including fighting Ra's in the desert, stopping him from unleashing a deadly virus, and fathering a child with Talia (without his knowing). It was also confirmed that Bane had once made his move on Gotham and even broke Batman's back. In another adventure, the cult leader called Deacon Blackfire had assembled Gotham's poor as his followers and had Batman chained in his dungeon, tortured and drugged for days in an attempt to convert him into one of his followers, an attempt that failed. Batman manages to break free of Blackfire and convince his followers into turning against him, and Blackfire ends up getting killed by his own followers.</p><p>In Batman's early days, he formed a partnership with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent, an old classmate of Bruce's whom he had convinced into becoming Gotham's District Attorney. In their combined efforts, they targeted Carmine "The Roman" Falcone and his Crime Family, which sparked an immense gang war that ended with Falcone retreating to Hong Kong, and The Penguin, a rising crime lord himself, took his place as Gotham's ruler of organized crime. Batman keeps the Penguin in check, waiting for him to slip in order to take him down, but also uses him to gather information about the underworld.</p><p>Batman's partnership with Dent put him at odds with Bruce Wayne's old friend Eren Mckillen and her twin sister Sharon, daughters of the Irish Mob, who have have followed in their family's footsteps and even attempted to assassinate Jim Gordon. After their capture, the Mckillen Twins are given a life sentence thanks to Dent's efforts, and Sharon ends up committing suicide in order to give her sister, Eren the chance to escape and exact revenge on Dent. She does so by killing Dent's wife, Gilda, and burning half his face with acid before leaving the country. Dent would become Two-Face, one of Batman's most prominent enemies.</p><h3><strong>The Court of Owls</strong></h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/106890/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2114819" data-ratio="1.5434083601286" data-width="622" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 622px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:154.3%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/106890/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2114819"><img alt="The Court of Owls" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/106890/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/106890/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg 622w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/106890/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/106890/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="The Court of Owls" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/106890/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/106890/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg 622w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/106890/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/106890/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Court of Owls</figcaption></figure><p>After stopping an outbreak in Arkham Asylum with Dick Grayson’s help, Bruce attends a formal gathering in Wayne Manor and announces Wayne Enterprises' new goal of rebuilding certain districts of Gotham City as well as improving the train system. Later on, Batman investigates a crime scene with Harvey Bullock where he discovers a message saying “Bruce Wayne will DIE tomorrow” and after returning to the Bat Cave finds out from the analysis of some DNA samples found in the area, that the killer is Dick Grayson.</p><p>The following day, while meeting up with Lincoln March, Gotham City’s new mayoral candidate, for a conversation in the Old Wayne Tower, Bruce is attacked by a mysterious assassin who overpowers him and throws him off the window. Bruce struggles with the assassin in mid-air and manages to grab on to a gargoyle while the assassin falls down. He discovers that his attacker is an assassin sent by the Court of Owls known as the Talon, but does not believe it as the Court of Owls is simply an old nursery rhyme.</p><p>Batman manages to escape from a trap set by the Court of Owls during his investigation into whether they really exist or not. After returning to the Bat Cave, he tells Dick of how he investigated the existence of the Court some time after the death of his parents and discovered nothing. Continuing his investigation in the sewers of Gotham City, Batman is suddenly knocked out by the Talon; after waking up, he finds himself trapped in the Court’s labyrinth.</p><p>Batman has been missing for days, but Commissioner Gordon refuses to turn the Bat Signal off, using it as a source of hope for their allies and Gotham City. Batman is unable to escape the labyrinth and keeps finding himself returning again and again to the same places and is slowly being driven insane. The Talon then suddenly attacks Batman. Beaten and battered, all hope seems lost for Batman, but he manages to fight back and eventually defeats Talon. He finally escapes the labyrinth through an opening he causes after an explosion and it leads him back to the Bat Cave.</p><h3><strong>Night of the Owls</strong></h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4293329" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 600px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:50.0%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4293329"><img alt="Batman defends his home against the Talons" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg 600w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="Batman defends his home against the Talons" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg 600w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman defends his home against the Talons</figcaption></figure><p>Soon after escaping the labyrinth, the Court of Owls sends out all of their Talons to attack the public figures of Gotham City in order to take it back. In the Bat Cave, Bruce reveals to Nightwing that the Talon who attacked him is William Cobb, Dick’s great-grandfather, as well as the fact that he was meant to be a Talon as well. Later on, numerous Talons then attack Bruce in his home, and after making his way to the Bat Cave, attempts to fight them off using a special armor. While analyzing the data found on a Talon’s gauntlet, Alfred finds a list of assassination targets for the Talons. Alfred calls the rest of the family (Red Robin, Red Hood, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, and the Birds of Prey), asking for their help to save Gotham City.</p><p>Batman deduces that the Talons are weakened by cold and has Alfred reduce the cave temperature, giving Batman the chance to finish them off. Batman then goes to Arkham Asylum in order to save Dr. Arkham; Talons attack them both until the inmates are released who then proceed to attack the Talons. He then proceeds to Lincoln March’s location to save him but is too late; he finds a dying March who gives him a message, the names of three members of the Court of Owls.</p><p>After scaring off one of the members of the Court in their own house, Batman goes to Harbor House, a building he investigated in search of the Court back when he was a child. He swears to end the Court of Owls once and for all. However, he finds them all dead in the dining room and realizes who was behind this attack and goes to Willowood Home for Children, a hospital for children suffering from mental illnesses and neurological disorders. He finds Lincoln March, who staged what looked to be the Court of Owls suicide.</p><p>As he dons a new advanced armor, March reveals that he is Bruce Wayne’s brother that never was, Thomas Wayne Jr. He claims to have been placed in Willowwood, back when it was a premiere hospital, after being born early and hurt due to a car accident. After Thomas and Martha Wayne died, Willowwood lost its funding and eventually became a mental hospital for mentally ill, lost and forgotten children.</p><figure data-ref-id="1300-3049967" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101306/3049967-bm_cv11_var.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.5131348511384" data-width="571" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 571px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:151.3%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101306/3049967-bm_cv11_var.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-3049967"><img alt="Batman vs March - Art by Andy Clarke &amp; Tomeu Morey" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" data-width="422" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101306/3049967-bm_cv11_var.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101306/3049967-bm_cv11_var.jpg 571w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101306/3049967-bm_cv11_var.jpg 422w"><noscript><img alt="Batman vs March - Art by Andy Clarke &amp; Tomeu Morey" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101306/3049967-bm_cv11_var.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101306/3049967-bm_cv11_var.jpg 571w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101306/3049967-bm_cv11_var.jpg 422w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" data-width="422"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman vs March - Art by Andy Clarke &amp; Tomeu Morey</figcaption></figure><p>Batman and Lincoln March fight all over the city and despite being overpowered, Batman manages to plant a small bomb on March’s back to stop him. March survives the explosion and manages to capture Batman once more, this time in a building where he begins to plant explosives. Batman manages to escape just in time as the explosives detonate, leaving March behind as he taunts him, telling him to run away from the truth.</p><p>Bruce has returned to Wayne Manor and is slowly healing from his wounds. He tells Commissioner Gordon that he privately searched the wreckage of the destroyed tower but didn't find anything. Dick arrives and Bruce tells him the truth: for one night, Bruce Wayne had a brother. His brother was born premature and with neurological damage and only lived for a single night. He explains his investigation on the matter, stating that the medical records were not faked and his parents would have told him if Thomas Wayne Jr. did survive. He says that the truth is a mystery for now, until he finds the evidence that will answer it. Bruce then declares that when the Court of Owls re-emerges, he will always be watching.</p><h3><strong>Born to Kill</strong></h3><p>Batman is now adopting his own son Damian as Robin, but has trouble coming to terms with his violent upbringing and is trying to overcome his son's nature with proper nurture, and at the same time, Damian thinks his father doesn't trust him and attempts to prove his worth to him.</p><p>The villain known as Nobody, who is in fact Morgan Ducard, son of one of Bruce's trainers, Henri Ducard, makes his presence known and confronts Bruce over the ineffectiveness of his crime-fighting methods. Nobody prefers to kill his enemies, and since Batman refused to see things his way, vowed to kill Batman and take Robin as his apprentice. After a deadly encounter with Nobody, tension between Batman and Robin grows, as Damian does not like how Bruce constantly hides things from him, notably his violent past with Ducard. Damian then leaves Wayne Manor to learn under Nobody who takes him on a mission to hunt down a corrupt ambassador in order to prove his new found will to kill. However, Damain reveals that this was plan to draw out Nobody and allow Batman to track him down. Learning this, Nobody starts to torture Damian and forces Batman to hear the sound over the radio. An enraged Batman eventually tracks down Nobody and defeats him in a savage fight before leaving him for the police. However, realizing that Nobody will return to torment them, Damian kills him much to Bruce's horror.</p><p>Back at the manor as Alfred heals their wounds, Bruce, instead of being angry, tells Damian that he understands Damian's struggle of whether or not to kill, but tells him they can't build a better world by repeating a cycle of violence, and he vows that he will never give up on his son.</p><p>Shaken by the encounter with Nobody, Damian wants to prove to his father that he is capable of compassion while also proving that he is the best Robin, even challenging his predecessors. After several months, Damian returns to his father with a pearl from Martha Wayne's pearl necklace, which had fallen apart and into the sewers on the night Bruce's parents were shot. This gift touched Bruce, and despite some initial problems, brought the two closer than ever.</p><h3><strong>Death of the Family</strong></h3><p>Over a year ago, Joker had escaped from Arkham and after tracking him down, Batman defeated him and put him back. There, Joker arranges for the Dollmaker to cut off his face before escaping, and his face is left in the GCPD. A year later, <a href="/joker/4005-1702/" data-ref-id="4005-1702">Joker</a> makes his return by breaking into the GCPD, killing 19 police officers and reclaiming his face. He then proceeds to make a live broadcast saying that the mayor will die at midnight but ends up killing the mayor's entire staff instead.</p><p>After an encounter with Harley Quinn at ACE Chemicals, Batman goes back to Wayne Manor where he learns that Alfred was kidnapped. He realizes that Joker is reenacting his previous crimes, so he goes to the Gotham Reservoir to confront Joker. There, Joker paralyzes him with his venom, blows up the reservoir and tells him that he knows his secret identity before escaping.</p><p>Batman is brought back to the Batcave by the Bat-Family, where he confesses that after an early battle with the Joker, he discovered a joker playing card in the Batcave but denies the fact that Joker knows their identities. However, they are still unconvinced.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/140903/2871162-995.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2871162" data-ratio="1.3840830449827" data-width="578" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 578px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:138.4%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/140903/2871162-995.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2871162"><img alt="Dinner Time!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/140903/2871162-995.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/140903/2871162-995.jpg 578w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/140903/2871162-995.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/140903/2871162-995.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="Dinner Time!" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/140903/2871162-995.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/140903/2871162-995.jpg 578w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/140903/2871162-995.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/140903/2871162-995.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dinner Time!</figcaption></figure><p>Further investiagtion leads Batman to Arkham Asylum where he is attacked by <a href="/mr-freeze/4005-3715/" data-ref-id="4005-3715">Mr. Freeze</a> , <a href="/scarecrow/4005-3726/" data-ref-id="4005-3726">Scarecrow</a> and Clayface , whom Joker has labeled as Batman's loyal subjects.

The Joker reveals that Alfred is alive, but poisoned by Jokers venom and has him serving them all their apparently cut-off faces as "dinner". The Joker then sets the table on fire, but Batman breaks free and manages to put out the fire. Batman removes Damian's bandages and it's revealed that it was all a sick joke and everyone was fine. Batman goes after the Joker and defeats him. He tells the Joker that he knows who he is but an angered Joker refuses to believe that and jumps down the cave's waterfall. The next day, Batman says that the Joker didn't care who he was under the mask, because it would ruin his fun. However, this entire ordeal caused a schism between the Bat-Family, as they no longer trust him because of his secrets.</p><h3><b>War with </b>Leviathan<b> and Death of Damian</b></h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4293448" data-ratio="0.76860537836148" data-width="1599" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1599px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:76.9%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4293448"><img alt="Death of Damian" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg 1599w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="Death of Damian" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg 1599w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Death of Damian</figcaption></figure><p>Batman's war with Leviathan continues where it is revealed that the mastermind is none other than Talia Al Ghul in another attempt to have Batman by her side in her quest for world domination.

Bruce considers retiring the Batman mantle but realizes that there should always be a Batman.</p><p>However, he later discovers that Damian and Talia's bodies have been dug up and taken by none other than Ra's Al Ghul.</p><h3><strong>Batman Eternal</strong></h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4293581" data-ratio="0.77334465195246" data-width="1178" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1178px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:77.3%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4293581"><img alt="The event that started it all" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg 1178w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="The event that started it all" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg 1178w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>The event that started it all</figcaption></figure><p>Commissioner Jim Gordon is arrested for manslaughter when he is tricked into shooting an electrical box, causing a massive train crash which kills hundreds of people.

The Architect attempts to destroy Wayne Tower but Batman manages to stop him. However, it is revealed that Bard has been working with the villain Hush, who infiltrated Wayne Manor, incapacitated Alfred, and stole from the Bat-Computer information about the locations of all of Batman weapon caches that are hidden around the city, and then detonated them, killing many people. In response, since all these depots are Wayne funded, Lucius Fox is forced to have Wayne Industries severe all ties with Batman, and as a result, Bruce Wayne loses much stock in his company and ends up bankrupt.</p><p>With Alfred injured, his daughter Julia Pennyworth, an S.A.S agent whom Batman previously met in Honk Kong, joins the fight and takes Alfred's place as his communication from the cave. With her help, Batman tracks down Hush and defeats him, but he discovers that Hush is merely another pawn, like Falcone. Bard, who holds a personal vendetta against Batman because a copycat vigilante caused the death of his partner and girlfriend, attempts to kill him by taking control of the Batmobile, but Batman survives, and ends up threatening Bard. Because of his actions, the GCPD turns on Bard.</p><p>Mystical forces are at work at Arkham Asylum as part of an old villain known as Deacon Blackfire's machinations, in which his followers attempt in the story to bring him back. Batman sends Batwing and Jim Corrigan to investigate, but things go awry and Corrigan is forced to release the powerful fictional being called The Specter who destroys Arkham Asylum and puts an end to Blackfire's plans. Batman would later rescue Batwing from the wreckage.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Arkham escapees (Freeze, Scarecrow, Bane, Clayface, Joker's Daughter), who were taken down by Batman earlier, are freed by the mysterious benefactor, and they, along with other c-list criminals like Cluemaster, Signalman and Firefly, are presented with all of Batman's weapons and are told to use them in any way they please.</p><p>Batman is sent on a wild goose-chase, chasing down false leads and taking down rampaging enemies while his city burns. In the end, he receives an invitation to Wayne Tower where he is confronted, much to his surprise, by Cluemaster, who reveals himself to be the mastermind and that he had also deduced Batman's identity. Batman beats down Cluemaster, but the villain manages to gain the upper hand on the tired hero, but before the finishing blow, he is killed by the true mastermind, Lincoln March, who used Cluemaster, funded his plans and now wants to kill Batman himself.</p><p>In their final battle, the two found themselves in the middle of the city, with Batman too weak to fight, only to find Jim Gordon, having been cleared of his charges thanks to a guilt-ridden Bard, rallying Batman's allies and the entire city. March is then defeated but he manages to escape into the sewers, only to be caught by the Court of Owls, who intend to punish him for his betrayal.</p><h3><strong>Batman: Rebirth</strong></h3><h4>I Am Gotham</h4><p>While reestablishing his war on crime, Batman is dealing with a criminal who stole a missile and used it to knock a plane out of the sky. Batman manages to divert the plane away from the city, but has to sacrifice his life in order to safely crash the plane. Before it crashes, <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gotham/4005-130013/" data-ref-id="4005-130013">Gotham</a> and <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gotham-girl/4005-130014/" data-ref-id="4005-130014">Gotham Girl</a>, two new Superman-level heroes dedicating to saving Gotham City, save the plane and Batman. After the two are later seen fighting Solomon Grundy, Batman intervenes when the fight endangers a homeless man. At their request, he decides to show them the ropes. Along the way, Bruce wrestles with feelings of inadequacy over not having super-powers. While he helps them, he also tracks down their parents in hope of learning about their origins. He continues to help the two protect Gotham, but none of them are aware that Hugo Strange is behind the different incidents they have been tackling and that he has been monitoring them. While they team up to track down information on a suicide bomber, Batman leaves them to search for leads.</p><p>When he finds them again, he sees dozens of massacred soldiers, a missing Gotham, and Gotham Girl in a perpetual state of fear, a victim of <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/psycho-pirate/4005-25495/" data-ref-id="4005-25495">Psycho Pirate</a> and Strange working together. He then tracks down Gotham, who has become unhinged due the Psycho Pirate altering his mind. Bruce tries talking him down, but when he mentions the dead soldiers, Gotham flies off. Seeking more information about what's happening to Gotham, Duke finds a lead connecting everything to <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/suicide-squad/4060-40394/" data-ref-id="4060-40394">Task Force X</a>. Bruce then breaks into <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/amanda-waller/4005-4920/" data-ref-id="4005-4920">Amanda Waller's</a> office demanding answers. Surprisingly, she is honest with him: she recruited Strange and Psycho Pirate to be her agents in Gotham, but they betrayed her and began driving people crazy, the most recent victim's being Gotham and Gotham Girl. She offers to help him if he says "please," leaving him disgusted that she could make light of 27 dead agents. Amanda corrects him, saying she had <strong>28 </strong>agents. Batman then realizes why Gotham was in a rush earlier, and races to find him. He then returns to the residence of Gotham's parents and puts the pieces together. The last soldier secretly survived, and managed to unmask Gotham long enough to track his face and find his parents, and went to kill the Gotham duo's parents to avenge his comrades.</p><p>Batman reaches the house to find he is too late: Gotham's parents are dead and Gotham himself is poised to kill the last soldier. Batman tries to talk him down, but Gotham kills the man anyway and leaves, as Psycho Pirate filled him with unquenchable rage that he now wants to unleash on the entire city. Batman is too far away to stop him, so he has Alfred dress up as him and stall. He then calls the Justice League, who arrive to subdue him. However, Gotham is too powerful, even for Superman. Unable to defeat him, Batman convinces Gotham that represents everything he hates about the city and to kill him instead. Before he can do so, Gotham Girl arrives, having temporarily beaten back the fear Psycho Pirate instilled into her. She then kills her brother, ending the threat.</p><p>In the aftermath, Gotham Girl resumes hero work, despite the fact that she is talking to her dead brother as though he is there. The following night, Duke monitors her progress from the Batcave and calls Bruce to let him know, and presses him about helping her. His response is simply, <em>I know</em>. Two days later, he catches up to Gotham Girl and tries to talk her down, and while he manages to reach her slightly, he fails to snap her out of her episode and she flies off. As he knocks out the criminal Gotham Girl stopped, he asks Alfred for advice on dealing with someone who has lost their family. However, seeing how Bruce turned out, he has no pertinent advice to offer. The next day, as she is flying over GCPD Headquarters, Batman shine the Bat-Signal on her to get her attention. This time, rather than offer her help, he asks her why she is ''helping'' the city. She explains that she is helping for a reason no one understands: because it eases the pain of losing their family. In a bid to reach her, he unmasks himself and tells her how he felt when his parents died. He hugs her and tells her that he still speaks to his mother to this day. With that, she finally opens, telling him she badly misses her brother. His response is, again, just <em>I know</em>. </p><p>The next day, Batman goes to talk to Waller again o find out where Psycho Pirate is. She explains that everything Strange did was part of a deal to trade Psycho Pirate for a supply of Venom large enough to have come from only one place <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/santa-prisca/4020-56874/" data-ref-id="4020-56874">Santa Prisca</a>, home of <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/bane/4005-6129/" data-ref-id="4005-6129">Bane</a>. Waller explains that to get to Psycho Pirate, he must invade a sovereign country, break into the most secure prison on Earth, and get his target away from Bane. However, she has a way to do it. However, it is a plan that is extremely risky, or as she calls it, <strong><em>suicidal.</em></strong></p><p> </p><h2><strong>Personality</strong></h2><figure data-ref-id="1300-2664527" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134088/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.51875" data-width="640" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 640px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:151.9%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134088/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2664527"><img alt="Batman" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px" data-width="421" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/134088/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134088/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg 640w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/134088/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg 632w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/134088/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg 421w"><noscript><img alt="Batman" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/134088/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134088/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg 640w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/134088/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg 632w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/134088/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg 421w" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px" data-width="421"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman</figcaption></figure><p>Witnessing the death of his parents traumatized Batman and shook him so greatly that he swore he would devote every breath for the rest of his life to eliminating crime and criminals from Gotham City. This has, in turn, transformed Batman into a dark, suspicious and brooding figure with a personal grudge against injustice. His traumatized childhood has made it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred Pennyworth and his various proteges the Robins. Despite his cold demeanor, Batman genuinely cares for Alfred, who he sees as a father figure, and the Robins, who he loves as his own children, though these relationships have been strained at some points.</p><p>His dedication to fighting crime has gradually turned into a sort of obsession, something with which Batman himself has come to terms. He has vowed to end the evil that took away his parents permanently, and is willing to do everything he can to accomplish this goal. This obsession is balanced with his strong ideals of justice and moral values, which were instilled to him by his humanitarian parents. His dedication is backed up by his indomitable will and his strong resolve.</p><p>Despite his lack of powers, Batman's immense will, combined with his inventive mind and resourcefulness has allowed him to hold his own against more powerful foes. However, the biggest aspect of Batman's personality is his moral code. Despite his inventiveness, he refrains from killing as he believes that will make him no better than the criminals he puts behind bars. Batman knows that he walks a very thin line between sanity and insanity, and he believes that the only thing that keeps him from crossing that line is that he will not kill. He has vowed to never take a life under any circumstances, because he fears what he would become in case he ever did kill. When confronted by Jason Todd on why he never killed the Joker after all the atrocities that he has committed, Batman responded that, despite his desires to do so, he will never do it because that would cause him to go to a dark place and become what he has always fought against, and he would never be able to come back.</p><p>Batman also has a deep love for humanity, which also backs his no-killing rule, and he truly believes that deep down, people can be good. This is shown when he was willing to give the Joker a second chance and offered to help him cure his madness. (This failed because the Joker had already "re-insane-ized" himself in advance, specifically to stay evil.) He also has an extreme distaste for firearms, and always tries to refrain from using them, because he considers the gun to be the weapon of cowards, the same weapon that killed his parents.</p><p>Batman has also forged an alternative personality to conceal the secrecy of his dual identity, that being the persona of "Bruce Wayne," an irresponsible, clumsy, arrogant, womanizing, billionaire philanthropist. This personality contrasts with Batman's more serious demeanor in order to sway the public from ever deducing his secret identity. In order to complete his facade, Batman modifies many of his physical traits, including his voice tone, his body language, and, of course, his behavior. However, even as Bruce Wayne, he has attempted to do good, through charitable campaigns, renovation projects and also the funding of Batman Incorporated.</p><h2><strong>Character Profile</strong></h2><p><strong>Real Name:</strong> Bruce Wayne</p><p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Head of Wayne Industries, superhero/vigilante</p><p><strong>Height:</strong> 6ft 3in</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 225 lbs</p><p><strong>Hair:</strong> Black</p><p><strong>Eyes:</strong> Blue</p><p><strong>Base:</strong> Gotham City</p><p><strong>Partnerships:</strong> <a href="//www.comicvine.com/dick-grayson/4005-1691/" data-ref-id="4005-1691">Nightwing</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/alfred/4005-5556/" data-ref-id="4005-5556">Alfred Pennyworth</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/james-gordon/4005-3727/" data-ref-id="4005-3727">Commissioner Gordon</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/barbara-gordon/4005-5368/" data-ref-id="4005-5368">Batgirl</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/damian-wayne/4005-42413/" data-ref-id="4005-42413">Robin</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/tim-drake/4005-9290/" data-ref-id="4005-9290">Red Robin</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/jason-todd/4005-6849/" data-ref-id="4005-6849">Red Hood</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/catwoman/4005-1698/" data-ref-id="4005-1698">The Catwoman</a>, <a href="/leslie-thompkins/4005-3740/" data-ref-id="4005-3740">Leslie Thompkins</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/stephanie-brown/4005-6156/" data-ref-id="4005-6156">Spoiler</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/cassandra-cain/4005-65230/" data-ref-id="4005-65230">Black Bat</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/superman/4005-1807/" data-ref-id="4005-1807">Superman</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/jean-paul-valley/4005-12834/" data-ref-id="4005-12834">Azreal</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/harvey-bullock/4005-5554/" data-ref-id="4005-5554">Harvey Bullock</a>, <a href="/renee-montoya/4005-3716/" data-ref-id="4005-3716">Renee Montoya</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/talia-al-ghul/4005-4917/" data-ref-id="4005-4917">Talia al Ghul</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/man-bat/4005-6131/" data-ref-id="4005-6131">Man-Bat</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/batwoman/4005-9052/" data-ref-id="4005-9052">Batwoman</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/zatanna/4005-5691/" data-ref-id="4005-5691">Zatanna</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/kathy-kane/4005-81174/" data-ref-id="4005-81174">Kathy Kane</a>, <a href="/bat-mite/4005-23170/" data-ref-id="4005-23170">Batmite</a>, <a href="/ace-the-bat-hound/4005-31302/" data-ref-id="4005-31302">Ace the Bat Hound</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/carrie-kelley/4005-13164/" data-ref-id="4005-13164">Carrie Kelley</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/wonder-woman/4005-2048/" data-ref-id="4005-2048">Wonder Woman</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/creeper/4005-5713/" data-ref-id="4005-5713">The Creeper</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/deadman/4005-5690/" data-ref-id="4005-5690">Deadman</a>, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/silver-st-cloud/4005-22134/" data-ref-id="4005-22134">Silver St. Cloud</a>, <a href="/julie-madison/4005-38196/" data-ref-id="4005-38196">Julie Madison</a></p><h2><strong>Powers and Abilities</strong></h2><p>Though he does not posses any innate superhuman abilities, Batman is considered by many (even <a href="/superman/4005-1807/" data-ref-id="4005-1807">Superman</a>) to be among the most dangerous men in the world. Throughout the many years that he has been around, Batman has become one of the most powerful human beings in the DC Universe, despite having no superhuman powers at any time in his life. Starting at the age of 14, Bruce began to train with brilliant minds on the planet to learn about biology, criminology, anatomy and other areas that would help him become the World's Greatest Detective.</p><p><strong>Jack-Of-All-Trades And Master Of Many</strong></p><p>Batman is also a master of stealth, disguise, and escapology, using his Ninjutsu training. He has infiltrated high security strongholds and systems including Lexcorp. He has vanished in plain sight from regular humans and metahumans, such as <a href="/azrael/4005-25845/" data-ref-id="4005-25845">Azrael</a>. His stealth skills are so great that that even groups of superheroes such as the <a href="/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/" data-ref-id="4060-19241">Legion of Super Heroes</a> have been unable to locate him. His accuracy is said to be on par with Green Arrow himself. He is the second greatest escape artist, behind <a href="//www.comicvine.com/mr-miracle/4005-5703/" data-ref-id="4005-5703">Mr. Miracle</a>. Batman has escaped a straitjacket in 52 seconds, then stated that it was too slow for him. He always carries several lock picks with him. He commonly uses disguises, his most notable one being Matches Malone.</p><p><strong>Large Supply of Money and Resources</strong></p><p>To acquire all of these skills, Bruce needed money. When his parents died, Bruce inherited millions of dollars from the Wayne Fortune which he later turned into billions through investing. Bruce owns and runs Wayne International, as well as <a href="/batman-inc/4060-57839/" data-ref-id="4060-57839">Batman Incorporated</a>.</p><p><strong>Intelligence</strong></p><p>Batman is considered to be the "World's Greatest Detective," solving the biggest secrets with small or large amounts of data. He is also fluent in many different languages such as English, Spanish, French, Russian, German, Japanese, Chinese, and others. Bruce has vast knowledge in criminology, psychology, medicine, and anatomy. Batman is a excellent strategist, and always keeps himself steps ahead of his opponents.This incredible ability is due to the fact he studies his opponents, not only physically but also mentally. He has led the Justice League, the Bat-family, the Outsiders, and served as mentor for the Justice League International. He is a highly knowledgeable in business, great in finances and marketing. He has earned degrees in multiple subjects before the age of 25. He has hacked into alien and future technology.</p><p><strong>Master Martial Artist</strong></p><p>Batman has been said to be trained in every martial art known to man, and out of every single one of those forms of fighting, he knows 127 that are deadly. These 127 are the main forms of fighting that make up his normal fighting style. He is known to change his styles in order to become unpredictable to his opponents. His primary style of combat though is a mixture of Judo, Ninjitsu, Muay Thai, Tae Kwon Do, Jujitsu, Boxing, Karate and Dragon Style Kung Fu.</p><figure data-ref-id="1300-2530506" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131238/2530506-batweightraining.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.5681470137825" data-width="653" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 653px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:156.8%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131238/2530506-batweightraining.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2530506"><img alt="Batman's Daily Routine" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" data-width="408" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/131238/2530506-batweightraining.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131238/2530506-batweightraining.jpg 653w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/131238/2530506-batweightraining.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/131238/2530506-batweightraining.jpg 408w"><noscript><img alt="Batman's Daily Routine" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/131238/2530506-batweightraining.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131238/2530506-batweightraining.jpg 653w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/131238/2530506-batweightraining.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/131238/2530506-batweightraining.jpg 408w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" data-width="408"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman's Daily Routine</figcaption></figure><p>Because of his training, Batman has also mastered nearly all weapons known to man, even most firearms--even though he despises these last, considering them cowards's weapons, and repeatedly avoids using them himself. Batman's combat skill surpasses most metahumans and normal men, and he even knows every pressure point and nerve strike in the human body, as well as Dim Mak ("death touch") techniques. These can cause dangerous pain to his enemies which can lead to dizziness, numbness, unconsciousness, temporary paralysis, disorientation, and even death.</p><p><strong>Peak Human Conditioning</strong></p><p>Due to his intense training and diet Batman has accomplished feats that normal human beings might call superhuman. Batman is in peak physical and mental condition. Batman has displayed surprising strength, and is able to bench press weight of at least 1000 pounds, and has personally stated that his maximum leg press weight is 2500 lbs (over 1.133 Kg). However, as shown in Batman Odyssey # 2, Batman was able to overcome his personal record leg press, moving, with the strength of the legs, a stuck railroad car. In Gotham After Midnight # 2, Batman was able to hold up two golden sarcophagi with the approximate weight of at least 1 ton, for at least one minute. In addition, Batman is an accomplished gymnast and acrobat, though not quite at the level of <a href="/dick-grayson/4005-1691/" data-ref-id="4005-1691">Nightwing</a>. Batman's training and peak condition mean he's very fast, both in combat and on his feet. This speed combined with his strength, make him phenomenally powerful; even the enhanced assassin <a href="/deathstroke/4005-3588/" data-ref-id="4005-3588">Deathstroke</a> has commented upon the power and skill of the Batman. He once grabbed Green Arrow's arrow shot at him in mid-air and dodged point blank fire at times. He can hold his breath for 3 minutes and 15 seconds. He once survived in an airless vacuum of space for exactly 27 seconds.</p><h2><strong>Weapons and Equipment</strong></h2><h3><strong>Gadgets</strong></h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-1786207" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/86187/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.5787037037037" data-width="648" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 648px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:157.9%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/86187/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1786207"><img alt="Batman - David Finch" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px" data-width="405" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/86187/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/86187/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg 648w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/86187/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg 608w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/86187/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg 405w"><noscript><img alt="Batman - David Finch" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/86187/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/86187/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg 648w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/86187/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg 608w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/86187/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px" data-width="405"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman - David Finch</figcaption></figure><p>Batman is most notable for his use of <a href="../../utility-belt/18-46369/" rel="nofollow">gadgetry</a>. Due to his wealth, money is no obstacle to the development of various gadgets and paraphernalia he uses in fighting crime. The most recognizable of these is the Batarang, a razor throwing weapon that has a returning ability similar to a boomerang. This was slowly replaced by his grappling hook as a favored gadget over time. Other items include smoke or flash grenades, caltrops, a re-breather, and various types of anti-venom. The heels of his boots have a sonic device which can summon a swarm of bats to his location. This allows for dramatic escapes or diversions to keep his enemies busy. Superman entrusted Batman with a green kryptonite-jeweled ring in order to stop him should he ever go rogue.</p><p><strong>Bat-Suit</strong></p><p>The <a href="https://www.comicvine.com/bat-suit/4055-55745/" data-ref-id="4055-55745">Bat-Suit</a> is an experimental military body armor that is too expensive for the military to produce. Various bat-suit designs have appeared over the years, but all maintain the fact that Bruce's suit is tear resistant, bulletproof, and immune to temperature extremes(it will not melt if in contact with fire, etc.). The suit is shock absorbent and acid resistant. It is made to rebound punches and kicks. When he is unable to defend himself, his mask emits knock out gas and electrical shocks to attackers who are attempting to remove any part of his gear. The Bat-Suit has shown that it has an outer layer that can be shed when trapped, and it also masks any DNA on his suit. However, despite all this protection, the suit has shown vulnerabilities to sharp objects, like knives, and Batman has sometimes decreased the amount of armor in the suit to increase mobility. In the past, Batman wore a bright yellow chest plate with a bat-symbol on it, to distract enemies from targeting his face and instead focusing on the plate which is reinforced with kevlar, giving Batman extra protection.</p><h3><strong>Cowl</strong></h3><p>The cowl has a computer link directly to the Bat computer. The mask has a hollow bat-ear assembly containing a directional microphone, telescoping high gain antenna and a fiber optic coaxial cable. It also contains an audio processor that can transmit and receive audio which can be augmented for better hearing, or even completely shut down when dealing with an opponent that uses sonic weaponry. The cowl contains a built-in recorder that is constantly recording, and the information is stored in the cowl archives for later reference. The lens can also magnify his vision and serves also as a lie detector. They also come with x-ray, thermal, sonar, and night vision. It has face recognition and can give information about the people around him. It also protects him against throat trauma, and its internal comm-link enables voice command over various equipment including grapple hooks, face recognition softwares and vehicles.</p><h3><strong>Gloves/Gauntlets</strong></h3><p>Batman's gloves, or gauntlets, are very handy as in addition to covering his hands so that he will not leave fingerprints behind, they come with a high-velocity Bat-rope and a wrist laser. They can also emit a high voltage surge of electricity to stun enemies and shoot, out their forearms, spikes, smoke pellets and anesthetic gas. Each gauntlet has three spiked fringes emerging from it, and they can be fired at an opponent or used to defend against, or even break the blades of, swords.</p><h3><strong>Cape</strong></h3><p>Throughout many revisions, all the versions of Batman's cape still retain the scalloped wing design at the bottom of the cape, which is instrumental in intimidating criminals. The cape is made from a "memory fiber," which is based on a nylon derivative, allowing it to flow like any fabric, but through an electrical surge applied by Batman's gloves, it becomes stiff and takes on a distinctive shape, thus functioning in a way similar to a parachute, used to slow Batman's fall and allow him short-range "gliding" flight. It is flame-resistant (to temperatures which have not been conclusively gauged) and can be used to help conceal Batman in the shadows, to protect him from debris as a result from explosions, and even, sometimes, as a weapon in combat.</p><h3><strong>Utility Belt</strong></h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-118292" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/118292-44795-batman.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1" data-width="360" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 360px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/118292-44795-batman.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-118292"><img alt="Batman's toys" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-width="640" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/118292-44795-batman.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/118292-44795-batman.jpg 360w"><noscript><img alt="Batman's toys" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/118292-44795-batman.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/118292-44795-batman.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-width="640"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman's toys</figcaption></figure><p>Batman’s <a href="../../utility-belt/18-46369/" rel="nofollow">Utility Belt</a> is one of his most iconic pieces of equipment.

This meaning that there are alternate timelines/futures and people that are unique in their own special way. From the events of the multiple Crisis, most of the Earths have been erased from history. Only 52 Earths remain in the entire universe.</p><h3><strong>Earth-11</strong></h3><p>On this gender-swapped Earth, Batman is Batwoman. Her real name is Helena Wayne, who is the daughter of Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle. She took up the mantle of the Bat after her father passed away.</p><h3><strong>Earth-2</strong></h3><p>On this earth, Batman retired as a police commissioner and married Selina Kyle (Catwoman). They had a daughter named Helena Wayne, also known as the Huntress.</p><p>Post-Flashpoint, Earth 2's Batman fought alongside Superman and Wonder Woman against the forces of Apokolips, and in the process died saving the planet. His daughter is transported to the main DC universe along with Earth 2's Supergirl, and there they take on the persona of the Huntress and Power Girl.</p><p>Current issues from the Earth 2 series have revealed that someone has taken up the cape and cowl of Batman. However this new Batman uses gadgets designed to kill and has been shown to be more than willing to kill criminals with rather brutal force.</p><h3><strong>Earth-3</strong></h3><p>On this third Earth, Bruce Wayne is actually Thomas Wayne, Jr. He is the son of the wealthy/powerful Thomas and Martha Wayne. This Earth did have a Bruce Wayne in the family, Thomas Wayne, Jr.'s little brother, however after the multitudes of crisis that have happened in the DC Universe, he was erased from continuity. Instead Thomas Wayne, Jr. is the mirror reflection of Bruce Wayne/Batman of New Earth. Thomas Wayne Jr.'s parents died and he inherited their fortune. He decided to train with assassins, mercenaries and masters of various skills to be a force of evil. As an adult Thomas Wayne, Jr. finds out that his father survived and is the Commissioner of the Gotham City police force. Thomas Wayne, Sr. knows that his son is Owlman and has decided to dedicate his life at bringing his son to Justice. Thomas Wayne Jr. hates his father for this and wants to kill him.

Earth-1 is to not be considered the "main Earth" or New Earth as it is called, however Bruce will be traveling around the world in search for retribution for his parents death. This story came out in late 2011, with artist <a href="../../gary-frank/26-1824/" rel="nofollow">Gary Frank</a> also working on the Graphic Novel.</p><p><strong>Earth-31</strong></p><p>On this Earth, Batman was 55 in The Dark Knight Returns. Having retired following Jason Todd's death, crime began to rise to an all time high in Gotham and times were worse than ever. Bruce had to don his Batman persona once again. Fighting various criminals/friends from the good old days, Batman is equipped with a 13-year-old female <a href="../../carrie-kelly/29-13164/" rel="nofollow">Robin</a> who will help Batman in his war on crime. Bruce has retired twice in this world and has to always come back to clean up after the government and their mess. Earth-31's Batman is a much darker Batman.</p><h3><strong>Earth-43</strong></h3><p>On Earth-43, Bruce Wayne/Batman was bitten by a female Vampire named Tanya, to oppose the king of vampires, Dracula. Tanya was a vampire that refused to draw on the blood of humans, and only wants to protect them from Dracula and his vampires. Tanya bites Batman, but instead of drawing blood, she transferred him new powers. Batman grew a disliking of the sun and gained incredible strength, speed, and agility. He also had the ability to grow wings in human form and become one with the shadows. While not wanting the blood of others, he had to use Tanya's a substitute to control the hunger. Most of Batman's villains were drained of blood when Tanya's was no longer sufficient. When this occurred, Bruce had already morphed into a giant bat like monster with fangs. Part of Batman's psyche and detective abilities stayed, but he is starting to loose it slowly. Since he wasn't a full vampire, he is hit with a stake in the heart and changed back to human form. Batman of Earth-43 still stands guard over his Gotham, but with the mark of a vampire.</p><h3><strong>Flashpoint</strong></h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-1701986" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1701986-flsp_pbkv_cv1.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.5" data-width="384" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 384px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:150.0%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1701986-flsp_pbkv_cv1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1701986"><img alt="Thomas Wayne as Batman" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" data-width="426" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1701986-flsp_pbkv_cv1.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1701986-flsp_pbkv_cv1.jpg 384w"><noscript><img alt="Thomas Wayne as Batman" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1701986-flsp_pbkv_cv1.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1701986-flsp_pbkv_cv1.jpg 384w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" data-width="426"></noscript></a><figcaption>Thomas Wayne as Batman</figcaption></figure><p>In <a href="../../flashpoint/39-56280/" rel="nofollow">Flashpoint</a>, the DC Universe's continuity thriller, the world has gone to hell.

In the restored timeline, Bruce Wayne is incredibly touched by his father's letter.</p><h3><strong>Zur-En-Arrh</strong></h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-2317816" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2317816-zur_en_arrh.jpeg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.2660377358491" data-width="530" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 530px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:126.6%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2317816-zur_en_arrh.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-2317816"><img alt="Bruce using the Zur-En-Arrh identity" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" data-width="505" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2317816-zur_en_arrh.jpeg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2317816-zur_en_arrh.jpeg 530w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2317816-zur_en_arrh.jpeg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2317816-zur_en_arrh.jpeg 505w"><noscript><img alt="Bruce using the Zur-En-Arrh identity" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2317816-zur_en_arrh.jpeg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2317816-zur_en_arrh.jpeg 530w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2317816-zur_en_arrh.jpeg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2317816-zur_en_arrh.jpeg 505w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" data-width="505"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bruce using the Zur-En-Arrh identity</figcaption></figure><p>On planet Zur-En-Arrh, Batman has superpowers. Near Batman's early creation, Ed Herron created this planet to give Batman abilities like Superman. Batman had all Superman's abilities and even a special weakness. In this comic, the Batman native to the planet was just a regular Batman like Bruce Wayne of Earth-1, with the name Kent Wayne (a combination of Bruce and Clark). He was raised by a rich family of farmers and when they eventually died, he became Batman. When Bruce Wayne came to his planet, Zur-En-Arrh Batman envied him because of how he was doing a greater job at Batman than he was. Eventually, Batman was weakened by a material on that planet, and Zur-En-Arrh had to remove his powers. After Crisis on Infinite Earths, this planet has been said to be erased from continuity.</p><h3><strong>Earth-5</strong></h3><p>On Earth-5, Bruce Wayne is only 8 years of age. Thomas and Martha Wayne are a rich family in Gotham City. Thomas is the legendary Batman with Martha as Batwoman. Bruce loves Batman and Batwoman and how they saved people. When he found out that his parents were his heroes, Thomas had no choice but to train him. With months of training, Bruce Wayne became Robin - The Boy Wonder.</p><h3><strong>Arkham City Earth</strong></h3><p>This Earth is similar to DC main continuity Earth-0 (New Earth); however, it differs from much of Batman's story. Still having his parents brutally murdered by a criminal, Bruce decides to devote his life to fighting crime in Gotham City. Years later, Batman finds himself in Arkham Asylum with Joker (and other Batman rogues) running the show; Batman locks himself in the asylum to stop Joker. Joker plans to create super thugs with the new Titan formula (a variation on the <a href="/venom/4055-47184/" data-ref-id="4055-47184">Venom</a> serum). Batman stops a Titan-infected Joker, but the serum's effects make Joker very sick. A year later, Quincy Sharp, the former warden of Arkham Asylum and now the mayor of Gotham, closes the Asylum and places Arkham inside Gotham City. Batman is trying to prevent Gotham from destroying itself because of the Mayor's choice. This occurs in the <a href="/batman-arkham-city/4050-40090/" data-ref-id="4050-40090">Batman: Arkham City</a> mini-series.</p><h3><strong>Earth-7642</strong></h3><p>This Earth, otherwise known as the Crossover Earth, is where DC main continuity coexists with the Marvel 616 universe. <a href="/spider-man/4005-1443/" data-ref-id="4005-1443">Spider-Man</a> visits Gotham City after a psychologist, Cassandra Briar, believes she can cure the <a href="/joker/4005-1702/" data-ref-id="4005-1702">Joker</a> of his insanity with a cranial microchip the same way she did <a href="/carnage/4005-1490/" data-ref-id="4005-1490">Carnage</a>. The insane duo eventually escape, and Batman is forced reluctant to partner with Spider-Man to save the city. This first meeting between the two occurs in <a href="/spider-man-and-batman/4050-22438/" data-ref-id="4050-22438">Spider-Man and Batman</a>.</p><h3><strong>Earth-9602</strong></h3><p>Otherwise known as the <a href="/amalgam/4045-43725/" data-ref-id="4045-43725">Amalgam</a> Universe, this Earth is a combination of DC's New Earth (Earth-0) and Marvel 616.

Batman does not like the involvement of Danger Girl, but neither does he like the threat which they pose. The Joker does not trust Conrad and attempts to double cross him as he sends Harley and Conrad to retrieve the codes to use the device. <a href="/abbey-chase/4005-17820/" data-ref-id="4005-17820">Abbey</a> and <a href="/sydney-savage/4005-17825/" data-ref-id="4005-17825">Sydney</a> come across Bruce Wayne, who invite them to a gala.

Batman lures Superman by kidnapping Wonder Woman. Once Superman was in position, Batman bombarded him with red sunlight in order to weaken him. After beating up the weakened Superman to a pulp Batman locked him in a cellar, unfortunately for him Superman managed to convince Wonder Woman to destroy her lasso and destroy the lamps. When his plan failed Batman told Superman of Pyotr's treachery and committed suicide but Superman had no powers in a red sun only a yellow.</p><p>This wasn't the end of The Batman as other men have taken up the mantle after his death and brought justice to the streets of Russia.</p><h3>Injustice</h3><p>In this universe, Batman is one of the few renaming heroes to not join Superman's side after the destruction of Metropolis by the Joker. The Joker had tricked Superman into killing Lois Lane, who was carrying Superman's unborn child. Lois was also the trigger to a atomic bomb that the Joker had placed in Metropolis. Once Lois died, the bomb went off. Batman took the Joker into an interrogation room, but Superman came looking for the Joker. Superman impaled the Joker, thus killing him.</p><p>For the next few days and weeks, Batman stays off site, watching from afar as Superman starts to take action in order to stop all conflict around the world. But when Batman learns that the President tried to take Superman's parents as hostage, Batman shows up at the President's office. He states that he can't be naive to think he could touch Superman's parents and their not be any retaliation. Batman also tells the President that his actions have only helped strengthen Supeman's cause and that it will help rally other heroes to Superman's side.</p><p>Superman flies to the Batcave and confronts Batman about why he didn't help save his parents. Batman replies that he was doing other things that needed to be done. This angers Superman since he would have thought Batman would have known best how it feels like to have his parents taken away. Batman also replies that Superman and the others are scaring everyone on Earth. Superman and Batman then have a long debate about Superman's actions in recent days. After Superman leaves, Batman connects to the Justice League communication center and contacts AquaMan, warning him that Superman will soon want him to join.</p><p>When a new super hero by the name of Galaxor, is defeated by the rest of Justice League, Batman patches into the Flash's communicator and tells the Flash to a local research department. Their the Flash learns that Galaxor was a fan of the Justice League and the Flash was one of his idols who he looked up to. Batman tells Barry how he think Galaxor felt the moment when the same Justice League teams he looked up to was close to killing him for standing up to what he thought was wrong.</p><p>A few hours later, Batman, NightWing and Robin learn from a live news report that Arkham has been taken over and all of the inmates have been released. But given what has happened Robin (Damien Wayne), believes that Batman is doing things all wrong. The Joker could have been prevent from killing everyone in Metropolis if Batman had stopped locking him up in Arkham and Batman should have just killed him. Batman tells Damien that there is no time to argue but Damien refuses to listen to Batman anymore and decided to side with Superman.</p><p>Batman arrives before Superman and his team at Arkham. But when Superman, Wonder Woman and the rest make it, Batman exclaims that they don't have the right to decided how to deal with how the prisoners of Arkham will be handled. As Batman argues, he sees that Damien is with Superman and he didn't not stay in the Batcave like his father had order him to do. The cells begin to open and one by one the prisoners begin to vanish. Batman deduces that the Flash is behind it and he tells Superman to tell him at once where the prisoners are being take to. Cyborg is about to attack Batman, but is stopped by Green Arrow. Batman asks which side Green Arrow is with, but Green Arrow only states that he is at Arkham to drop of Harley Quin. Just at that moment Killer Corc and Soloman Grundy begin their attack.

Batman states that peace can't be enforced like how Superman is doing and Batman knowns why he was called by the President. If Superman does take over, Batman is the only one who can take him down. Before Batman leaves the room, he tells the President that he voted for him, making him laugh.</p><p>Batman and Catwomen then split up and start to recruit other heroes to their side. Heroes such as Green Arrow, Black Lighting and Captain Atom are recruited by Batman. When Hawkgirl tries to kidnap a world leader, Batman's team stops her. They take Hawkeye girl back to the Batcave and Catwomen asks Batman how he knew she was going to be there. Batman only replies by saying "I can't say".

The film was made during WWII; there is in fact a villainous Japanese scientist named Dr. Daka (J. Carroll Naish in yellow-face) as the villain. Although critically bashed, the film series did introduce the concept of the Batcave as well as a thin Alfred, prompting DC to remake the comics version into the version known today. A second film serial series was launched, titled <a href="https://www.comicvine.com/batman-and-robin/4025-222/" data-ref-id="4025-222"><em>Batman And Robin,</em></a> starring Robert Lowery as Batman, which followed Batman's and Robin's battle with the mad scientist The Wizard. Other characters in these films include Vicki Vale, Alfred, and Commissioner Gordon. With a higher budget and more solid acting, it is considered superior to the previous serial, but it still had errors with equipment and continuity, like the previous serial. Decades later, Batman returned to the big screen with <em><a href="https://www.comicvine.com/batman/4025-4/" data-ref-id="4025-4">Batman</a></em> (1989) and <a href="/batman-returns/4025-7/" data-ref-id="4025-7"><em>Batman Returns</em></a> (1992). Directed by <a href="/tim-burton/4040-61388/" data-ref-id="4040-61388">Tim Burton</a>, the two movies were darker and more serious than any comic book movie before, and were both big hits critically and financially. In 1995 Joel Schumacher made a third installment, named <a href="/batman-forever/4025-8/" data-ref-id="4025-8"><em>Batman Forever,</em></a> which tried to make Batman more family-friendly by introducing Robin and adding a sillier, campier tone akin to the '60s Adam West show. The movie received mixed reviews but was a hit at the box office, which led to Schumacher making a fourth installment, titled <em><a href="/batman-robin/4025-10/" data-ref-id="4025-10">Batman and Robin</a>.</em> The film was a massive disappointment with both critics and audiences alike, and effectively killed the Batman franchise.</p><p>In 2005, director Christopher Nolan brought Batman back to the big screen with <em><a href="/batman-begins/4025-12/" data-ref-id="4025-12">Batman Begins</a>.</em> This was followed by 2008's <a href="/the-dark-knight/4025-15/" data-ref-id="4025-15"><em>The Dark Knight,</em></a> which grossed over 1 billion dollars worldwide, making Batman a legitimate box-office presence.

The series was intended to be a lampoon comedy show because of producer William Dozier's initial ignorance of comic books; this likewise gave Dozier, who also narrated the series, the idea to "overdo" the series. The stories followed a format that was villain-driven and action-comedy heavy and tended to need two parts to complete. The first part usually involved a villain committing a crime with Batman and Robin attempting to stop the criminal, only to be caught and put in a death trap. The series is notable for the high profile guest stars, most of whom portrayed Batman's villains. One of these, <a href="/joker/4005-1702/" data-ref-id="4005-1702">the Joker,</a> as whom Cesar Romero guested on an almost semi-regular basis, was shown in color for the first time in this program, and Ben Nye Sr.'s make-up format was later adapted for Jack Nicholson's use in Burton's <a href="https://www.comicvine.com/batman/4025-4/" data-ref-id="4025-4">1989 film</a>.</p><p>The series also led to a cinematic adaptation called<em><a href="/batman-the-movie/4025-55/" data-ref-id="4025-55"> Batman: The Movie</a>.</em></p><p><em>Batman: The Live-Action Situation Comedy Television Series,</em> which was not legitimately released on home video (in DVD form) till 2014 because of legal hassles over copyright ownership of the series, is credited with actually having saved the character from dismal sales of the comics and enabling a new generation to come to know the character as he had once been and, indeed, as he had truly been intended to be.</p><h3><strong>Animation through the '60s, the '70's, and the '80s</strong></h3><p>Through the years Batman has spent more years animated on television than in a live action series. Starting in 1968, Batman and Robin made their animated debuts in an hour-long series called <em>The Batman/Superman Hour.</em> This program, a Filmation Associates production, featured Olan Soule as Batman and Casey Kasem as Robin. The Bat-Duo were featured in numerous animated shorts which had Batman and Robin battle various Batman villains, as well as teaming up with Batgirl. These shorts eventually were repackaged as a solo TV series titled Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder, which ignored other segments in favor of solo Batman and Robin adventures. Soule and Kasem would reprise their roles in the Scooby-Doo Movies featuring Scooby and the Gang meeting Batman and Robin while battling Joker and Penguin.</p><p>In 1977 running concurrently with <a href="/super-friends/4075-185/" data-ref-id="4075-185"><em>Challenge Of The Super Friends</em></a> was The New Adventures Of Batman, featuring Batman, Robin, Batgirl, and the creature called Bat-Mite, fighting the Gotham rogues, both classic and newly created villains. (This constituted the previously mentioned Batman segments of Tarzan And The Super 7.) Because of Adam West's and Burt Ward's involvements in the show, it could be considered a continuation of the 1960s Batman series. Due to copyright issues, however, <em>Challenge Of The Super Friends</em> had the use of the Riddler and the Scarecrow, making them off-limits to <em>The New Adventures Of Batman,</em> while this series had use of the Joker, preventing his use in <em>Challenge</em> as a Legion of Doom member.</p><h3><strong>DC Animated Universe</strong></h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-3347726" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120019/3347726-7897192410-135182.jpeg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="0.57176470588235" data-width="425" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 425px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:57.2%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120019/3347726-7897192410-135182.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-3347726"><img alt="Batman: The Animated Series" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/120019/3347726-7897192410-135182.jpeg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120019/3347726-7897192410-135182.jpeg 425w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/120019/3347726-7897192410-135182.jpeg 320w"><noscript><img alt="Batman: The Animated Series" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/120019/3347726-7897192410-135182.jpeg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120019/3347726-7897192410-135182.jpeg 425w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/120019/3347726-7897192410-135182.jpeg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman: The Animated Series</figcaption></figure><p>Starting in 1992 the critically acclaimed <a href="../../dc-animated-universe/12-44865/" rel="nofollow">DC Animated Universe</a> series of animated TV shows began, consisting of <em><a href="/batman-the-animated-series/4075-17/" data-ref-id="4075-17">Batman: The Animated Series</a>,</em> <em><a href="/superman-the-animated-series/4075-12/" data-ref-id="4075-12">Superman: The Animated Series</a>,</em> <em>The New Batman/Superman Adventures,</em> <em><a href="/batman-beyond/4075-116/" data-ref-id="4075-116">Batman Beyond</a>,</em> <em><a href="/justice-league/4075-47/" data-ref-id="4075-47">Justice League</a>,</em> <em><a href="/justice-league-unlimited/4075-57/" data-ref-id="4075-57">Justice League Unlimited</a>,</em> <em><a href="/static-shock/4075-153/" data-ref-id="4075-153">Static Shock</a>,</em> and <em><a href="/the-zeta-project/4075-380/" data-ref-id="4075-380">The Zeta Project</a>;</em> all of these shared both continuity and the involvement of actor Kevin Conroy as Batman. Throughout all these shows, a history of Bruce Wayne was recounted, from his childhood to glory days and dark times as well as him as an older man in retirement.</p><p>Many of the scripts of all the shows featured Bruce Timm, Alan Burnett, Paul Dini, Dwayne McDuffie, Stan Berkowitz, and Hilary Bader, creating a Batman that was very consistent in between all shows. All of the series have been met with acclaim due to the treatment of subject matter that told stories in a way that was child friendly but still attracted older audiences.</p><p>This is true especially for the treatment of Batman staying true to many versions of him and having stories lifted or inspired by the Batman mythos. The series also introduced Harley Quinn and Renee Montoya to the Batman mythos. Soon after Batman the Animated Series ended, Batman appeared (once again) in a guest spot for Superman: The Animated Series before starring in his own show titled The New Batman Adventures. In these adventures, Batman along with many other characters featured a new costume design many of which were recast including Batgirl who was elevated into Batman's partner. Dick Grayson left Gotham and soon used his Nightwing identity that was displayed in the comics. A new Robin came in the form of Tim Drake (who had Jason Todd's origin story). These new revamped episodes not only showed Batman fighting the same villains but new ones as well some created for the show itself.</p><p>Before the scenes in <a href="/batman-beyond-return-of-the-joker/4025-128/" data-ref-id="4025-128">Return of the Joker</a>, Batman was shown having many adventures with the Justice League involved in the creation of that team offering his own money and service but preferring to stay a reserve member. That did not stop him from developing friendships with Superman, Flash, Hawkgirl, and Wonder Woman, whom it is implied he shared a romantic attraction. Over the series Batman would often be the one of the critical members and often serve as a way to solve a problem showing his importance. Though Justice League is that last produced series in the DCAU, it chronologically takes place before Batman Beyond.</p><h4><strong>Batman Beyond</strong></h4><figure data-ref-id="1300-445848" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/445848-mantle.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="640" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 640px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/445848-mantle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-445848"><img alt="An old Bruce with Terry McGinnis" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/445848-mantle.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/445848-mantle.jpg 640w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14751/445848-mantle.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/445848-mantle.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="An old Bruce with Terry McGinnis" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/445848-mantle.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/445848-mantle.jpg 640w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14751/445848-mantle.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/445848-mantle.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>An old Bruce with Terry McGinnis</figcaption></figure><p>Batman Beyond is a continuation of Batman's legacy, the series is set in 2039, and follows a teenage Terry McGinnis as the new Batman.

Seeing the need for a demonstration act after the weak society showed rebellion, the government issued a strict order for the kidnapping of more than 14,500 families.</p><p>When the 15,000 children of those families were forced to watch the massacre of their parents, half of them committed suicide, or completely disregarded these events had ever happened. Out of all of them, one of them could not forget these events, seeing the inhumane society he lived in, this child swore vengeance against all evil, only that child would enforce it in any way possible, he would become <a href="/batman/4005-1699/" data-ref-id="4005-1699">Batman</a> One Million.</p><p>Already aware about the Batman-Legacy and the many Batmen there already were, he chose the symbol of the bat because he felt that it stood for more than simply fear; it stood as an ideal, it stood for justice. Knowing what was necessary to succeed in his mission, he began training, honing his abilities just as hundreds of others who had taken the mantle of the bat had done before him.</p><p>After years of patience, training, studying, and preparing, Batman One Million took to the dangerous Asylum Planet, Pluto, along with his sidekick, Robin One Million. Soon after, he was invited to join a new incarnation of the Justice League, Justice Legion Alpha, where he met Superman One Million, Flash One Million, among others. After years of working together, they went back in time to invite the our era of the Justice League to see the rebirth of 1st Superman.</p><p>Unexpectedly, their companion Starman betrayed them and unleashed a plague onto Earth, with the real Justice League being unable to stop it, Justice Legion Alpha was there to assist them. Batman One Million worked with our Batman to find a way to stop Starman's plans, along with Dick and Tim, using the technology of the Batcave. Batman One Million succeeded in stopping his plans, ending up with Starman returning to the light once more and committing suicide to stop what he had done. Batman One Million and his companions returned to their era, along with our Justice League, to watch the return of the Prime Superman.</p><h2>Personal Stats</h2><ul><li><strong>Real Name</strong>: Unknown</li><li><strong>Base</strong>: Earth, Asylum Planet</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 235</li><li><strong>Height</strong>: 6'6"</li><li><strong>Hair Color</strong>: Blond</li><li><strong>Eye Color</strong>: Blue</li><li><strong>Known Relatives</strong>: Bat-Family, unnamed parents.</li></ul><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p><strong>Polymath</strong>: Over the course of his life-time, this Batman has trained his mind and body to brilliant perfection.

The body had been resurrected by the powers of the <a href="/black-power-ring/4055-55739/" data-ref-id="4055-55739">Black Rings</a> during the <a href="/blackest-night/4045-55766/" data-ref-id="4045-55766">Blackest Night</a> story arc.

These pits could revive the corpse and return Batman to <a href="/gotham-city/4020-23611/" data-ref-id="4020-23611">Gotham</a> and the world. The very action he had denied another holder of the Robin title, <a href="/tim-drake/4005-9290/" data-ref-id="4005-9290">Tim Drake</a>, who had wanted to revive his father using the same pit.

Bruce Wayne Jr. did not truly appreciate his father's legacy, although he did train to the same levels both physically and mentally (as did <a data-ref-id="4005-1691" href="/dick-grayson/4005-1691/">    Dick Grayson</a>, who became Wayne, Sr.'s junior partner <a data-ref-id="4005-1687" href="/robin/4005-1687/">   Robin</a>).  </p> <p>Unlike Grayson, who was appreciative of the Batman affiliation, Wayne Jr. resisted his father's heroic legacy; he had not gone through the same personal loss of family as his father and Grayson. Wayne, Jr. also did not want to be known merely as the son of his famous father. Because of their similar situations, being thought of as mere successors to famous fathers, Wayne Jr. and his friend <a data-ref-id="4005-55007" href="/superman-junior/4005-55007/">  Superman, Jr.</a> went on a road trip in a period of self discovery. It is during this excursion that Wayne, Jr. determines his own sense of sense and decides to become the successor of his father in his own way. Superman, Jr. has come to a similar realization and together they form the team known as The Super-Sons. </p> <p>When Bruce Wayne Sr. was murdered, Wayne, Jr. reluctantly teamed up with his father's former ward Grayson who was more appreciative of the Batman identity, even challenging Wayne, Jr. for the right to become the next Batman. Grayson and Wayne, Jr. put aside their differences and successfully teamed up to find Wayne, Sr.'s killer who was revealed not to have actually succeed in killing Wayne, Sr. Grayson and Wayne, Jr. agreed to disagree who would be the next Batman though came to respect each other's abilities and determination as both successful protegees of Batman, Sr. in their own respective identities.  </p>    Bruce Wayne, Jr. along with all members of his reality were erased from reality during the <a data-ref-id="4045-40764" href="/crisis-on-infinite-earths/4045-40764/"> <i>Crisis on Infinite Earths</i></a>, which retroactively erased him and his reality from ever having existed.]]></description><first_appeared_in_issue><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-125455/]]></api_detail_url><id>125455</id><name><![CDATA[The Sons of Superman and Batman]]></name><issue_number>154</issue_number></first_appeared_in_issue><gender>1</gender><id>16818</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/2284837-superman___batman___generations_tpb___p146.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/2284837-superman___batman___generations_tpb___p146.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/2284837-superman___batman___generations_tpb___p146.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/2284837-superman___batman___generations_tpb___p146.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/2284837-superman___batman___generations_tpb___p146.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2284837-superman___batman___generations_tpb___p146.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/2284837-superman___batman___generations_tpb___p146.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Batman Junior]]></name><origin><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/origin/4030-4/]]></api_detail_url><id>4</id><name><![CDATA[Human]]></name></origin><publisher><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/publisher/4010-10/]]></api_detail_url><id>10</id><name><![CDATA[DC Comics]]></name></publisher><real_name><![CDATA[Bruce Wayne Junior]]></real_name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/batman-junior/4005-16818/]]></site_detail_url><resource_type><![CDATA[character]]></resource_type></character><character><aliases><![CDATA[The Dark Knight of Zur-En-Arrh

Victor also uses his trade mark weapon: his freeze gun, which can instantly freeze anything into a solid block of ice in a matter of seconds.</p><h2>Scarecrow</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/455/94484-167146-scarecrow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-94484" data-size="medium" data-ratio="1.56" data-width="400" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 400px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:156.0%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/455/94484-167146-scarecrow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-94484"><img alt="Scarecrow" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-width="400" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/455/94484-167146-scarecrow.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/455/94484-167146-scarecrow.jpg 400w"><noscript><img alt="Scarecrow" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/455/94484-167146-scarecrow.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/455/94484-167146-scarecrow.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-width="400"></noscript></a><figcaption>Scarecrow</figcaption></figure><p><a href="/scarecrow/4005-3726/" data-ref-id="4005-3726">Scarecrow</a>’s real name is Jonathan Crane. Jonathan is also known as the Master of Fear. Jonathan’s parents abandoned him, leaving him to grow up with his crazy religious grandmother. One of the worst things she did to him was locking him in the old church nearby, so the crows could attack him whenever he did something she disapproved of. Everyone at school abused and bullied Jonathan because of his gangly and weak appearance, often being called Scarecrow. Jonathan later went to school at the Gotham University to learn about psychology and biochemistry. He later got kicked out for firing a gun during one of his speeches about fear. He then developed his <a href="/fear-toxin/4055-56209/" data-ref-id="4055-56209">fear gas</a> and tested it out on his old bullies, wearing his Scarecrow costume for the first time. Jonathan seeks to gain respect through fear, power, and control. Jonathan does not have superpowers, but he is very intelligent, he can scare people and control people just through the power of speech. He uses his weaponized fear gas as well as his fear toxin through syringes. This gas or toxin makes all of someone’s worst fears come true, it has even given people heart attacks before.</p><h2>Calendar Man</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64770/1268927-julianday.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1268927" data-size="medium" data-ratio="1.1642857142857" data-width="420" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 420px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:116.4%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64770/1268927-julianday.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1268927"><img alt="Calander Man" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" data-width="420" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64770/1268927-julianday.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64770/1268927-julianday.jpg 420w"><noscript><img alt="Calander Man" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64770/1268927-julianday.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64770/1268927-julianday.jpg 420w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" data-width="420"></noscript></a><figcaption>Calander Man</figcaption></figure><p><a href="/calendar-man/4005-19682/" data-ref-id="4005-19682">Calendar Man's</a> Real name is Julian Day.

He realizes that he is not alone in his crusade against crime and his first order of business to to take his war on crime and go global. Announcing that Bruce Wayne has been secretly funding the Batman for years, Wayne Enterprises intends to take Batman Global, making it an empire with the hopes of ultimately crushing crime. Batman's first order of Business is to include his "family" into the fold. Giving each member assignments. The full extent of these has yet to be realized. Batman leaves Dick Grayson in charge of Gotham along with his son, Damian, as Robin. Also in his return, Batman has donned a new Bat-suit.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Batman Incorporated was created by writer <a href="/grant-morrison/4040-40434/" data-ref-id="4040-40434">Grant Morrison</a>, when he brought Bruce Wayne from his crisis in Time. It is shown that since Bruce has returned, his physical body has gained more knowledge on events of the future. He has also gained more knowledge on how to stop crime. Thus Batman Inc. Grant made this team known in Batman And Robin #16. Batman Incorporated is considered, by Grant Morrison, to be a second re-installment of the team known as the <a href="/batmen-of-all-nations/4060-46378/" data-ref-id="4060-46378">Batmen of All Nations</a>. The Batmen of All Nations were formed by Bruce Wayne (like Batman Incorporated is founded by) and they were brought together by Batman to stop all crime in the nations that the team was chosen from. While the Batmen of All Nations appeared on 1955 in Detective Comics #215, the team has usually operated when Batman might've been missing. Which was shown in Grant Morrison's Batman R.I.P. The team has operated more in Gotham, together all of the members, more than anywhere else. Batman Inc is considered to be the second incarnation of the team.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>The first recruitment mission saw <a href="/dick-grayson/4005-1691/" data-ref-id="4005-1691">Dick</a> and Bruce go to <a href="/paris/4020-56052/" data-ref-id="4020-56052">Paris</a>, <a href="/france/4020-55778/" data-ref-id="4020-55778">France</a>. Their arrival corresponded with a series of riots and political killings. The two Batmen foiled the plot with the help of a new vigilante named <a href="/nightrunner/4005-74514/" data-ref-id="4005-74514">Nightrunner</a>, and later formally inducted him as the first new member of Batman Inc, and the official Batman of France.</p><p>Bruce Wayne and <a href="/catwoman/4005-1698/" data-ref-id="4005-1698">Selina Kyle</a> then traveled to Japan, where Bruce hoped to recruit <a href="/mr-unknown/4005-73665/" data-ref-id="4005-73665">Mr. Unknown</a>. The original Mr. Unknown was killed by Lord Death Man, but Batman, Catwoman, and the new Mr. Unknown, Jiro Osamu, stopped <a href="/lord-death-man/4005-73917/" data-ref-id="4005-73917">Lord Death Man</a> (ultimately firing him into space) and Mr. Unknown, after faking his own death, became the Batman of Japan.</p><p>Bruce's next stop was Buenos Aires, Argentina. Bruce offered his longtime associate, El Gaucho, membership in Batman Inc, but the Argentinean crime fighter refused. Nevertheless, the two have teamed up in an investigation to locate three kidnapped children. The criminals behind the kidnappings were Scorpiana and the presumed deceased El Sombrero. El Sombrero forced Batman and El Gaucho to kill one another in order to save the children, but Bruce was able to beat the death trap and he and El Gaucho saved the children. However, Bruce learned during the fight that El Gaucho had a role in the death of Kathy Kane, the original Batwoman.</p><p>Later, Batman and El Gaucho teamed up with Batwoman and The Hood to stop Scorpiana and Dr. Dedalus on the Falkland Island. While Batwoman defeated Scorpiana, the Dr. Dedalus on the island was a fake and the true doctor is working for Leviathan. Bruce is next seen in Africa where he rescues his Batman Inc agent from a group loyal to Leviathan.</p><p>With DC Comics Continuity all returning to #1 in comics, Batman Incorporated will soon be getting an issue 1 in early 2012. Grant Morrison had this to say,</p><blockquote><p>“Batman, Incorporated will continue through to Issue #10 and August’s shocking season finale that changes the Batman status quo yet again. The series will take a brief hiatus while I work on a major new project to be announced shortly. Batman, Incorporated returns next year with me, Chris Burnham and Batman: Leviathan, the epic 12 part conclusion to my 6 year Batman saga. Don’t miss it!”</p></blockquote><h2>Batman Inc.

Darkseid's plan was for Bruce to acquire so much Omega energy that Bruce would destroy the universe itself, but Bruce stopped Darkseid's plan with the help of Red Robin and the Justice League. Bruce's entire outlook on the nature of Batman changed after his 'death.' He's come to embrace what he calls 'the first truth of Batman,' that being that Batman's war on crime was never a solitary mission. Bruce seeks to expand the Batman Family in a much more corporate nature. Bruce has two goals currently, to turn the symbol of Batman into the global antithesis of the very idea of crime, and to defeat a mysterious organization known only as Leviathan.</p><h4>Dick Grayson - Nightwing</h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82665/1808620-757606_736974_battle_for_the_cowl_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1808620" data-size="small" style="width: 600px" data-ratio="1.2483333333333" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:124.8%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82665/1808620-757606_736974_battle_for_the_cowl_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1808620"><img alt="Dick Grayson" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" data-width="512" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82665/1808620-757606_736974_battle_for_the_cowl_super.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82665/1808620-757606_736974_battle_for_the_cowl_super.jpg 600w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82665/1808620-757606_736974_battle_for_the_cowl_super.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82665/1808620-757606_736974_battle_for_the_cowl_super.jpg 512w"><noscript><img alt="Dick Grayson" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82665/1808620-757606_736974_battle_for_the_cowl_super.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82665/1808620-757606_736974_battle_for_the_cowl_super.jpg 600w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82665/1808620-757606_736974_battle_for_the_cowl_super.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82665/1808620-757606_736974_battle_for_the_cowl_super.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" data-width="512"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dick Grayson</figcaption></figure><p>Dick Grayson assumed the mantle of Batman during the events of <a href="/battle-for-the-cowl/4045-55808/" data-ref-id="4045-55808">Battle for the Cowl</a> after Bruce "died" at the hands of Darkseid and Gotham was plunged into chaos.

Edits that do not conform to these rules will be deleted. This is not 'Nam. There are rules.</p><p>1. This page is only for those Gotham heroes who do work, or have ever worked, <strong>directly</strong> under Batman, operating with his sanction, oversight and/or resources. Characters like <a href="//www.comicvine.com/catwoman/4005-1698/" data-ref-id="4005-1698">Catwoman</a>, the <a href="//www.comicvine.com/birds-of-prey/4060-22572/" data-ref-id="4060-22572">Birds of Prey</a>, and so on are <strong>NOT</strong> to be added to this page, as they have traditionally operated with a sizable degree of autonomy separate from Batman.</p><p>2. This page is only for the circle of Batman's allies that operate, or have operated for at least a major portion of their careers, in Gotham. Do <strong>NOT</strong> add <a href="//www.comicvine.com/batman-inc/4060-57839/" data-ref-id="4060-57839">Batman Incorporated</a> members like <a href="//www.comicvine.com/gaucho/4005-46379/" data-ref-id="4005-46379">El Gaucho</a>, <a href="/squire/4005-6527/" data-ref-id="4005-6527">Squire </a>and <a href="/nightrunner/4005-74514/" data-ref-id="4005-74514">Nightrunner </a>to this page. As far as possible, this page should be Gotham-centric.</p><p>3. This page is only for characters appearing in DC's prime continuity, whether pre- or post-Flashpoint. Do <strong>NOT</strong> add <a href="//www.comicvine.com/carrie-kelley/4005-13164/" data-ref-id="4005-13164">Carrie Kelly</a> or <a href="//www.comicvine.com/huntress-wayne/4005-45563/" data-ref-id="4005-45563">Helena Wayne</a> to this page on the grounds that they were both Robin in their respective alternate universes.</p><p>4. This page should only be tagged for appearance in issues where at least three or more members of the Batman Family appear <strong>together </strong>or working/interacting together. If Batman and the <strong>current </strong>Robin are the only two members of the Family to appear in a given issue, tag the <a href="//www.comicvine.com/batman-and-robin/4060-56496/" data-ref-id="4060-56496">Batman and Robin</a> team, not this one.</p><p>5.

Following his resurrection in Robin Rises: Alpha, Damian Wayne has resumed his career as Robin, this time with superpowers.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Dynamic Duo first formed when 9-year-old acrobat and circus performer <a href="/dick-grayson/4005-1691/" data-ref-id="4005-1691">Dick Grayson's</a> family was murdered by <a href="/anthony-zucco/4005-22815/" data-ref-id="4005-22815">Anthony Zucco</a>. The young orphan was taken in by Bruce Wayne, also known as <a href="/batman/4005-1699/" data-ref-id="4005-1699">Batman</a>, who realized that he needed an anchor to keep himself from getting out of control. Grayson was trained rigorously in the skills needed by a vigilante. At around the age of 13 he joined his guardian as his sidekick, using the name Robin, marking the introduction of the Dynamic Duo. There have since been a series of Robins who fight alongside Batman in <a href="/gotham-city/4020-23611/" data-ref-id="4020-23611">Gotham City</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The original Dynamic Duo was created in 1940 by <a href="/bob-kane/4040-19137/" data-ref-id="4040-19137">Bob Kane</a> and <a href="/bill-finger/4040-43591/" data-ref-id="4040-43591">Bill Finger</a>. The second incarnation, with <a href="/jason-todd/4005-6849/" data-ref-id="4005-6849">Jason Todd</a>, was introduced by <a href="/doug-moench/4040-42016/" data-ref-id="4040-42016">Doug Moench</a>. The third incarnation, with <a href="/tim-drake/4005-9290/" data-ref-id="4005-9290">Tim Drake</a>, was introduced by <a href="/marv-wolfman/4040-41478/" data-ref-id="4040-41478">Marv Wolfman</a>. The fourth incarnation, with <a href="/stephanie-brown/4005-6156/" data-ref-id="4005-6156">Stephanie Brown</a>, was introduced by <a href="/bill-willingham/4040-21511/" data-ref-id="4040-21511">Bill Willingham</a>. The fifth incarnation, with Dick Grayson as Batman and <a href="/damian-wayne/4005-42413/" data-ref-id="4005-42413">Damian Wayne</a> as Robin, was introduced by <a href="/grant-morrison/4040-40434/" data-ref-id="4040-40434">Grant Morrison</a>.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>Originally the team consisted of Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson. This team remained together for several years, until Grayson left to become Nightwing. He was replaced by Jason Todd, a young delinquent whom Batman had met while the former was attempting to steal his tires. This incarnation of the team remained together until the <a href="/a-death-in-the-family/4045-42218/" data-ref-id="4045-42218">Death in the Family</a> arc, when Todd was killed by the <a href="/joker/4005-1702/" data-ref-id="4005-1702">Joker</a>. For a time, the Dynamic Duo ceased to exist and Batman fought crime on his own. However, it became clear that he was spiraling dangerously out of control, and Tim Drake, a fan of Batman's, offered to step in and take the place of Robin. This incarnation of the team remained together until Drake resigned. He was briefly replace by Stephanie Brown, also known as the hero Spoiler. She was the first canonical female Robin, and was part of the Dynamic Duo until her apparent death at the end of the <a href="/war-games/4045-42226/" data-ref-id="4045-42226">War Games</a> arc. She was replaced by Drake, who resumed the mantle of Robin. After the death of Bruce Wayne and the <a href="/battle-for-the-cowl/4045-55808/" data-ref-id="4045-55808">Battle for the Cowl</a>, the team consisted of Grayson, who had taken up the mantle of Batman, and Damian Wayne, who had the role ceded to him by Drake. After Flashpoint and the launch of the DCnU, Dick Grayson returned to his role as Nightwing and Bruce and Damian Wayne became the new Dynamic Duo.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>A Death in the Family</h3><p>This arc opens with tensions between Batman and the second Robin, Jason Todd. Batman begins to regret his decision of allowing Todd to become Robin before he has fully come to grips with the deaths of his parents, and strips him of his position. Angered, Todd leaves, and after receiving documents that appear to indicate he isn't the son of the woman he called "mother," runs away from home to find his real mother. He is met in <a href="/lebanon/4020-56416/" data-ref-id="4020-56416">Lebanon</a> by Batman, who is tracking the Joker's attempts to sell a nuclear weapon to terrorists. After foiling a nuclear plot, they locate Todd's real mother, <a href="/sheila-haywood/4005-29604/" data-ref-id="4005-29604">Sheila Haywood</a>, in <a href="/ethiopia/4020-57800/" data-ref-id="4020-57800">Ethiopia</a>. The pair reunite, but it is revealed that Haywood is being blackmailed by the Joker, and she turns her son over to him. He beats Todd nearly to death with a crowbar, and leaves him and his mother in a warehouse, which explodes. Though Batman rushed to save them, he was unable to, and both die from their injuries.</p><h3>A Lonely Place of Dying</h3><p>Following the death of Jason Todd, Batman has grown increasingly reckless and violent in his vigilante activities. A young boy, Tim Drake, has been following the activities of Batman and Robin for many years, ever since he witnessed the deaths of the <a href="/flying-graysons/4060-55863/" data-ref-id="4060-55863">Flying Graysons</a>. While observing Robin, he notices the young man execute an acrobatic maneuver identical to one he saw Dick Grayson perform some time before. Drawing the connection between the two, Drake discovers Robin's secret identity. Soon after, having become troubled by Batman's increasing lack of control, Drake goes to Grayson in the hopes of convincing the former Robin to resume the mantle and aid Batman. Grayson agrees, but refuses to become Robin again, insisting he remain as Nightwing. Drake disapproves of this choice, and ultimately assumes the Robin identity himself, despite the objections of Batman. He is finally accepted by Batman after strenuous training, and after his mother is killed and his father is crippled in an attack.</p><h3>Knightfall</h3><p>Batman and Robin become the target of a plot by <a href="/bane/4005-6129/" data-ref-id="4005-6129">Bane</a>, who frees many supervillains from <a href="/arkham-asylum/4020-31682/" data-ref-id="4020-31682">Arkham Asylum</a> in an attempt to weaken Batman and pave the way for Bane to take control of the city. During the initial wave of supervillains, a rift forms between Robin and Batman over the latter's refusal to accept any help. Finally, greatly weakened, Batman is drawn into a confrontation with Bane, who bests him and breaks Batman's back. Taking time to recuperate from the devastating physical and emotional injuries, he refuses to pass the responsibilities of being Batman over to Nightwing, instead giving the identity to <a href="/jean-paul-valley/4005-12834/" data-ref-id="4005-12834">Jean-Paul Valley</a>, also known as Azrael. Drake accompanies Azrael, forming an interim Dynamic Duo, and observes that the new Batman is growing extremely unstable and paranoid after exposure to <a href="/scarecrow/4005-3726/" data-ref-id="4005-3726">Scarecrow's</a> fear gas, and disobeying Batman's orders. Azrael defeats Bane and entrenches himself as the new Batman while Bruce Wayne leaves Gotham along with <a href="/alfred/4005-5556/" data-ref-id="4005-5556">Alfred Pennyworth</a> to go on a quest to rescue Drake's father, <a href="/jack-drake/4005-6852/" data-ref-id="4005-6852">Jack Drake</a>, and Wayne's physiotherapist, <a href="/shondra-kinsolving/4005-26313/" data-ref-id="4005-26313">Dr. Shondra Kinsolving</a>.</p><p>In Gotham, Azrael becomes more ruthlessly violent, alienating Drake and <a href="/james-gordon/4005-3727/" data-ref-id="4005-3727">Commissioner Gordon</a>, who begins to believe Batman is no longer the man he had known. Batman's reputation in the public eye is also tarnished. Azrael becomes obsessed with his desire to be the better Batman, compulsively redesigning the costume to make it more powerful and deadly. His questionable activities reach a crux when he allows the villain <a href="/abattoir/4005-41369/" data-ref-id="4005-41369">Abattoir</a> to plunge to his death, unintentionally ensuring that Abattoir's innocent victim would also die. Meanwhile, Wayne travels to the Caribbean, and then <a href="/england/4020-55794/" data-ref-id="4020-55794">Great Britain</a>. He ultimately locates <a href="/shondra-kinsolving/4005-26313/" data-ref-id="4005-26313">Shondra Kinsolving</a>, who is being held by her step-brother, <a href="/benedict-asp/4005-26566/" data-ref-id="4005-26566">Benedict Asp</a>, who is using her psychic powers to nefarious ends. Caught in the psychic fight between the two, Wayne is healed by the resultant energy, and thus able to defeat Asp. Wayne leaves England to return to Gotham, but Pennyworth refuses to go along on the grounds that he doesn't want to see Wayne hurt himself any further.</p><p>Arriving in Gotham, Wayne encounters Drake. Learning of Azrael's various action in his absence, Wayne reacts with approval and decides to retire permanently as Batman, leaving Azrael in charge. However, Drake reveals Azrael's part in Abattoir's death, and Wayne demands that Azrael give up the Batman identity. Azrael refuses to step down, and threatens to kill Wayne. Wayne retreats and gets back into fighting shape with the help of <a href="/lady-shiva/4005-2222/" data-ref-id="4005-2222">Lady Shiva</a>. Returning to the cave, he takes back the identity of Batman, and goes in search of Azrael, who has gone to the house of <a href="/penn-selkirk/4005-26254/" data-ref-id="4005-26254">Penn Selkirk</a>, a man who he mistakenly believes is responsible for the death of his father. <a href="/catwoman/4005-1698/" data-ref-id="4005-1698">Catwoman</a> also turns up, and heavy fighting ensues that ranges across Gotham, culminating with a helicopter crash. Azrael escapes the crash, and has a final confrontation with Wayne in the caves below Wayne Manor. The fight ends with Azrael conceding defeat and abandoning the Batman identity. After this event, Wayne briefly passes the cowl to Grayson while he reassesses his position as Batman.</p><h3>War Games</h3><p>Stephanie Brown, the newest Robin, has recently been removed from her position as Robin. Hoping to regain Batman's trust, she sets in motion one of his most ambitious plans that, if properly executed, would result in all of the criminal underworld falling under the control of one Matches Malone. Little does she realize, however, that Matches Malone is, in fact, an alias of Batman's. Without Malone there, the plan falls apart spectacularly, resulting in a gang war that nearly consumes Gotham. Brown is kidnapped and tortured by <a href="/black-mask/4005-3724/" data-ref-id="4005-3724">Black Mask</a>, who seeks to gain control of all of Gotham's gangs. He succeeds with the help of Brown's information. She apparently dies from injuries sustained during the torture.</p><h3>Under the Hood</h3><p>A new vigilante, called the Red Hood, appears in Gotham. He has some success against the Black Mask, enough that the criminal joins with other supervillains to fight him. In his fight against the forces of these villains, the Red Hood is joined by Batman, and together the pair defeat the combatants. However, the Red Hood's willingness to kill sours his relationship with Batman, and the pair part on bad terms. They encounter one another again, and following a brutal fight, Red Hood reveals himself to be Jason Todd, apparently returned from the dead. Later, Red Hood again becomes involved in a fight with Black Mask, which ends, just as Batman arrives, with a knife through Red Hood's heart. However, this Red Hood was not Todd, who instead engages Batman in battle on the rooftops. Batman is momentarily distracted by an explosion in <a href="/bludhaven/4020-55771/" data-ref-id="4020-55771">Bludhaven</a>, which causes him to fear for the life of Nightwing; however, Todd refuses to allow him to abandon the fight. Eventually, Todd reveals that he holds no grudge against Batman for failing to save him, but he does take issue with the Joker's continued existence. He reveals that he has kidnapped the Joker, and places a gun to Joker's head, insisting that Batman must kill Todd, or Todd will kill Joker himself. Batman takes a third option, stabbing Todd with a <a href="/batarang/4055-46297/" data-ref-id="4055-46297">batarang</a>. Todd sets off explosives in the building and escapes, leaving Batman and Joker in the wreckage.</p><h3>One Year Later</h3><p>Following a year-long absence from Gotham, Bruce Wayne and Tim Drake return, and begin investigating a new vigilante who has been using deadly force against various low-level villains. <a href="/two-face/4005-5555/" data-ref-id="4005-5555">Harvey Dent</a>, who has reformed and taken up crime fighting in Batman's absence, is initially suspected, and ultimately relapses into a life of crime because of the resentment and paranoia derived from his place as suspect. Ultimately, the true culprit, <a href="/great-white/4005-9063/" data-ref-id="4005-9063">Great White Shark</a>, is uncovered. After the crime is solved, Wayne offers to adopt the recently orphaned Drake, who accepts.</p><h3>Battle for the Cowl</h3><p>Following the death of Bruce Wayne, Gotham erupts in chaos. Nightwing is reluctant to take up the cowl, despite Drake's urging. Damian Wayne is attacked while driving through the streets, and rescued by Nightwing. However, the pair is cornered by members of the Black Mask's gang, who surround them and attempt to kill Nightwing. They are saved by a mysterious figure who claims to be Batman. He is revealed instead to be Jason Todd, who shoots Wayne and escapes. Drake later discovers a disused subway platform that Todd is using as his <a href="/batcave/4020-31340/" data-ref-id="4020-31340">Batcave</a>. He and Todd get into a fight, which ends with Todd stabbing Drake through the abdomen with a batarang. Nightwing tracks Drake down, on the way revealing that Batman had left him a message asking Nightwing not to assume the cowl. Damien meanwhile has recovered from surgery and is given a Robin outfit in which to carry out his part in the ensuing fight. Nightwing discovers the makeshift Batcave and confronts Todd, who asks that Nightwing join him as Robin, while Todd will assume the role of Batman. Nightwing refuses and instead plays a message for Todd that was left behind by Batman. This message, which is an apology for not getting the help that Todd needed, angers Todd, who detonates explosives in his Batcave. The explosions nearly kill Drake, who survived the earlier attack, but he is rescued by Wayne and <a href="/squire/4005-6527/" data-ref-id="4005-6527">Squire</a>. Nightwing and Todd meanwhile continue their fight, which concludes when Nightwing kicks Todd off the side of the train they are fighting on. He offers to pull Todd off the side of the track, but Todd refuses and allows himself to fall into the water. Nightwing finally decides to take up the Batman identity, and is joined by Wayne as the new Robin.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><p><b><i>The Dark Knight Returns</i></b></p><p>An older Bruce Wayne emerges from retirement and retakes the role of Batman, while a young girl named <a href="/carrie-kelly/4005-13164/" data-ref-id="4005-13164">Carrie Kelly</a> assumes the role of Robin.</p><p><b>Bruce Wayne, Jr.</b></p><p>Following Batman's retirement, Dick Grayson takes over the role of Batman, and Wayne's son, <a href="/batman-junior/4005-16818/" data-ref-id="4005-16818">Bruce Wayne, Jr.</a>, takes the role of Robin.

They were a resurrected plot from former Batman comics.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The Ghosts were a product of a collaboration of the <a href="/gotham-city-police-department/4060-42090/" data-ref-id="4060-42090">Gotham City Police Department</a> and <a href="/doctor-hurt/4005-54826/" data-ref-id="4005-54826">Doctor Hurt</a>. It was a time when the Gotham PD became worried of the day when Batman would disappear. All this happened under a different Commissioner, hence only a few officers had know what transpired.</p><p>While Doctor Hurt was assisting Batman in an experiment regarding Space Isolation he introduced the Gotham PD Batmen. At the time Batman thought these other Batmen were possible futures, which he coined as Three Ghosts in his Black Case Book, and beat them to a pulp.</p><p>The Batmen project was shelved but the Three Ghosts had been damaged and were given severance from Gotham PD. Still they remain sleeper against just waiting for the "Bat-signal in their heads" to light up.</p><h2>The Ghosts</h2><p><strong>Batman with a Gun</strong></p><p>Josef Muller was a cop coined as an ace marksman. He simply wore a Bat-suit and carried a gun. When the he faced Batman in the isolation chamber, Batman broke his hands.<br />He was the first of the Ghosts to re-surface. Joker thinking he was the Batman, beat him close to death until the real Batman intervenes.</p><p>He shoots Joker and is never heard from again.</p><p><strong>Bat-Bane</strong></p><p>Officer Branca was a family man who followed orders. He allowed Doctor Hurt to inject him with Venom and all sorts of drugs.

Batman...</figcaption></figure><p>Out of every superhero in the <a data-ref-id="4015-40391" href="/dc-universe/4015-40391/">DC Universe</a>, there are hardly two that are more different then <a data-ref-id="4005-1807" href="/superman/4005-1807/">Superman</a> and <a data-ref-id="4005-1699" href="/batman/4005-1699/">Batman</a>. Superman takes on crises as they arise. He is so fast and powerful that if a bad thing happens, he will shoot over and stop it so fast that whatever hapless villain was making a stir ends up in jail faster than light. Batman prefers a crushing, preemptive strike. If a crisis will happen, you can guarantee that the Dark Knight will have known about it and already have a detailed, workable plan formulated to stop it. Crises don't happen in Batman's territory-for the Caped Crusader stops them before they start. Given that these approaches are totally different, it's odd that these two would work together.</p><p>But Superman and Batman actually have their own team-that is how often they collaborate to fight evil.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13344/278660-58723-superman--batman.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-278660" data-size="medium" style="width: 400px" data-ratio="1" data-width="400" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13344/278660-58723-superman--batman.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-278660"><img alt="Team Up Logo" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13344/278660-58723-superman--batman.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13344/278660-58723-superman--batman.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-width="400"></a><figcaption>Team Up Logo</figcaption></figure><p>Much of the distance is in power discrepancy. Superman can move faster then the speed of light. He is literally impossible to damage in any physical way-only magic and Kryptonite affect him. He has nearly unlimited strength-he has moved planets. He never tires and he has an array of other weapons. His heat vision can melt steel, he can freeze nearly anything with ice breath, his super breath can make airplanes stop in midair, and he can fly. He is nearly unstoppable.</p><p>Batman has no powers-he is merely a man. But Batman is honed to the physical and mental peak. He is one of the three smartest men in the DCU, along with <a data-ref-id="4005-19179" href="/mr-terrific/4005-19179/">Mr. Terrific</a> and <a data-ref-id="4005-41952" href="/lex-luthor/4005-41952/">Lex Luthor</a>.

His reason-a Kryptonite asteroid is heading towards Earth, and Luthor blames Superman.

Before Dick became Batman with Damian Wayne as his Robin, Clark was still struggling with Bruce dying. While he wasn't actually dead, however, lost in time, Superman and the other heroes didn't know yet. While other heroes missed Bruce greatly, Superman was the one who missed him the most. Clark and Bruce were the worlds finest heroes, they fought one another, however also destroyed a whole bunch of crime together. With Bruce gone, Superman felt guilty for not being the "man of steel (or shield)" for his best friend. When Dick Grayson was beginning his early days as Batman, Dick was testing one of his pre-suits before his modern suit. Superman got really angry at this point, because he missed his friend Bruce, so eventually with the help of Wonder Woman, Superman adjusted to Dick being Batman.</p><h3>Supergirl and Damian Wayne</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1363893-15770_400x600.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1363893" data-size="medium" style="width: 400px" data-ratio="1.5" data-width="400" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:150.0%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1363893-15770_400x600.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1363893"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-width="400" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1363893-15770_400x600.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1363893-15770_400x600.jpg 400w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1363893-15770_400x600.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1363893-15770_400x600.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-width="400"></noscript></a></figure><p>This was a short team-up that had Kara Kent (Supergirl) teaming up with Robin (Damian Wayne). When there was a massive death count in <a data-ref-id="4020-56534" href="/suicide-slums/4020-56534/">Suicide Slums</a>, Supergirl went seeking for a Master Detective. Mainly Dick Grayson or Tim Drake. However, instead she found Damian Wayne in a situation against <a data-ref-id="4005-3725" href="/killer-croc/4005-3725/">Killer Croc</a>. When Damian told Supergirl that Dick Grayson was with the <a data-ref-id="4060-31815" href="/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/">Justice League Of America</a> and Tim was following his own adventure, Supergirl was going to just leave Damian with taking Killer Croc to jail. But unknown to her, Damian surprised her with talking about the killings in Suicide Slum. After grudgingly listening to Damian boast in himself, Supergirl knew that she needed to capture the killer, and allowed Damian to work with her. Later in the <a data-ref-id="4020-41184" href="/metropolis/4020-41184/">Metropolis</a> city Morgue. Damian and Supergirl were studying the bodies of the victims that were killed in Suicide Slum. The victims eventually led to Scarecrow, and the team (Damian and Supergirl) beat him with ease and took him jail.</p><h3>Damian and Conner</h3><p>In the not to distant future, Damian Wayne is Batman with Conner Kent as Superman. Superman and Batman (Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne) both died protecting the universe from an omega level threat. To replace them, Conner Kent has chosen to become the newest Superman and Damian Wayne as Batman. For a mysterious reason (probably something in the past before the deaths of Superman and Batman) Damian and Conner hate one another. However, once every year, they join one another at midnight to honor the two most important/influential people in their lives, Clark and Bruce. Damian and Conner are portrayed in their late 50's to early or mid 60's. Damian states that he is training Terry McGinnis to be the newest Batman, while Conner is about to retire his cape to someone else.</p>]]></description><first_appeared_in_issue><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-120155/]]></api_detail_url><id>120155</id><name><![CDATA[The

previously seen in animated form. Along with backup from ex-secret agent Alfred and lethal swordstress Katana, the Dark Knight faces the twisted machinations of Gotham City’s criminal underworld led by the likes of Anarky, Professor Pyg, Mister Toad and Magpie. Produced by Warner Bros. Animation, this action-packed detective thriller deftly redefines what we have come to know as a “Batman show.” Featuring cutting-edge CGI visuals to match the intricate twists and turns of the narrative, Batman steps out of the shadows and into the spotlight for an entirely new generation of fans.</em></p><p><em>Starring Anthony Ruivivar (Banshee) as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Beware The Batman boasts a stellar voice cast with JB Blanc (The Count of Monte Cristo) as Alfred and Sumalee Montano (ER) as Katana.</em></p><p><em>With WBAs Sam Register executive producing, and Batman Beyond's Glen Murakami and Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated's Mitch Watson producing, Beware The Batman is one of the more radical series based on the famed Dark Knight to be added to DC Nation, Cartoon Network’s Saturday morning programming block.</em></p>]]></description><first_episode><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/episode/4070-1195/]]></api_detail_url><id>1195</id><name><![CDATA[Hunted]]></name><episode_number>101</episode_number></first_episode><id>32</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/3332701-bat.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/3332701-bat.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/3332701-bat.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/3332701-bat.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/3332701-bat.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/3332701-bat.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/3332701-bat.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><last_episode><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/episode/4070-14185/]]></api_detail_url><id>14185</id><name><![CDATA[Alone]]></name><episode_number>126</episode_number></last_episode><name><![CDATA[Beware the Batman]]></name><publisher><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/publisher/4010-10/]]></api_detail_url><id>10</id><name><![CDATA[DC Comics]]></name></publisher><site_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/beware-the-batman/4075-32/]]></site_detail_url><start_year>2013</start_year><resource_type><![CDATA[series]]></resource_type></series><series><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/series/4075-687/]]></api_detail_url><count_of_episodes>33</count_of_episodes><date_added>2017-02-18 11:51:06</date_added><date_last_updated>2017-02-18 11:51:06</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[The First Batman animated series]]></deck><description/><first_episode><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/episode/4070-22016/]]></api_detail_url><id>22016</id><name><![CDATA[The Fiendishly Frigid Fraud]]></name><episode_number>115</episode_number></first_episode><id>687</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/5707384-250px-filmation_batman+robin_title_1960s.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/5707384-250px-filmation_batman+robin_title_1960s.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/5707384-250px-filmation_batman+robin_title_1960s.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/5707384-250px-filmation_batman+robin_title_1960s.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/5707384-250px-filmation_batman+robin_title_1960s.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/5707384-250px-filmation_batman+robin_title_1960s.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/5707384-250px-filmation_batman+robin_title_1960s.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><last_episode><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/episode/4070-22016/]]></api_detail_url><id>22016</id><name><![CDATA[The Fiendishly Frigid Fraud]]></name><episode_number>115</episode_number></last_episode><name><![CDATA[The Adventures of Batman]]></name><publisher/><site_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-adventures-of-batman/4075-687/]]></site_detail_url><start_year/><resource_type><![CDATA[series]]></resource_type></series><series><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/series/4075-689/]]></api_detail_url><count_of_episodes>15</count_of_episodes><date_added>2017-02-19 16:20:56</date_added><date_last_updated>2017-02-22 09:51:11</date_last_updated><deck/><description><![CDATA[<p>2nd Batman animated series.
