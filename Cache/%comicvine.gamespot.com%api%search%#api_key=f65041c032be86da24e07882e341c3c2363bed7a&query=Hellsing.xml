A man of many vices and many indiscretions, who nonetheless managed to increase the Hellsing Organization's influence beyond its primitive scope and allow for further expansion. Educated at Balliol College as a descendant of Abraham van Helsing, he was assigned a young butler who had also spent some time in that school: Walter C. Dornez. Arthur, during WWII, developed a severe case of borderline alcoholism and unquenchable lust for carnal pleasures, and with the influence he commanded, he very rarely denied himself these desires. Despite this, he held a firm hand upon the estate's resources, and was eventually entrusted with the family seat at the Convention of Twelve and the knowledge of the loyal Nosferatu sworn to obey his orders without question. Catankerous and outspoken, he never feared voicing his opinion without remorse or concern. His main friends, through all his life, were Sir Hugh Irons and Sir Shelby Penwood, both of who held similar chairs in the Convention of Twelve. Their group was thus a formidable power source in the British Empire of WWII.</p><p>Midway through WWII, Arthur and his friends started receiving accumulating rumors of horrors unspoken in a Polish camp where a mysterious Projekt, Order 666, had been issued. Words of secret experiments and undead monsters became serious enough to convince the trio to authorize the deployment of a higher class of weapon to combat the burgeoning threat: the Hellsing monster. Pairing him with Dornez, Arthur ensured the destruction of the camp though he was unaware of a mysterious circumstance, as of yet unrevealed, that allowed for the Projekt main three figures, the Major, the Captain and the Doctor, to survive the carnage virtually unscathed, a circumstance that had much to do with Walter. Some time later, he grew weary of Alucard, believing him too strong a weapon to be solely relied upon, and had him sealed and any records of his existence cloaked or destroyed to continue the Organization's work through more conventional soldiers. He retained Dornez as a butler and eventually promoted him to retainer of the family.</p><p>Eventually, he somehow found a woman who he found good enough to become his wife, and sired a single daughter, Integra. His brother Richard tolerated his excesses in the hopes of reaching the power Arthur enjoyed. His wife died before Integra was twelve, and eventually his lifestyle caught up with him and caused to start slipping into a deep sickness. He revealed to Integra in hushed tones about Alucard's existence and resting place, and tried to ensure his power was passed down to her. Richard found this unbearable and attempted to kill her only to set in motion the events that led to the genesis of the <i>Hellsing </i>manga.</p><p>By all means, Richard was not a perfect man. Obnoxious, drunk, loud and outspoken, not many liked the odd Hellsing heir. Even his close friend Sir Shelby Penwood would later admit to Integra he found himself occasionally fastidiated by Arthur's now and then over-the-top demands for weapons, alcohol and fun, and while Sir Hugh Irons recognized him as a great man, he also commented he had been a fool for trusting Walter, foreshadowing his role in the Final Night of London.</p>]]></description><first_appeared_in_issue><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-251482/]]></api_detail_url><id>251482</id><name><![CDATA[Vol. 1]]></name><issue_number>1</issue_number></first_appeared_in_issue><gender>1</gender><id>62850</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/839243-54765_2223049587_bfda73c731_thumb.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/839243-54765_2223049587_bfda73c731_thumb.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/839243-54765_2223049587_bfda73c731_thumb.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/839243-54765_2223049587_bfda73c731_thumb.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/839243-54765_2223049587_bfda73c731_thumb.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/839243-54765_2223049587_bfda73c731_thumb.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/839243-54765_2223049587_bfda73c731_thumb.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Arthur Hellsing]]></name><origin/><publisher><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/publisher/4010-2814/]]></api_detail_url><id>2814</id><name><![CDATA[Shōnen Gahōsha]]></name></publisher><real_name/><site_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/arthur-hellsing/4005-62850/]]></site_detail_url><resource_type><![CDATA[character]]></resource_type></character><character><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/character/4005-112067/]]></api_detail_url><birth/><count_of_issue_appearances>0</count_of_issue_appearances><date_added>2015-01-10 21:13:47</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-01-10 21:13:48</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Butler to the Alucard Vampire clan and one of the Six Heroes of Blazblue]]></deck><description/><first_appeared_in_issue/><gender>0</gender><id>112067</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/4322565-latest-26.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/4322565-latest-26.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/4322565-latest-26.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/4322565-latest-26.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/4322565-latest-26.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/4322565-latest-26.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/4322565-latest-26.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Valkenhayn R.

Soon after he married, a group of lawyers informed Abraham that he had inherited land from his family in a place called Wallachia. On the way to Romania, Van Helsing stopped to have a meeting with the lawyers in Bistritz. Elizabeth then went ahead to the manor to set it up for the night. One lawyer had a collection of Hun and Magyar artifacts that caught Abraham's attention. As he was studying them, he lost track of time.</p><h3>Finding Dracula</h3><p>Later on when he arrived to the manor, Elizabeth was nowhere to be found. As he looked for his wife, he found mutilated bodies with their necks bitten and the marking "XXX" burned into their flesh underneath their bitten necks.

This Dutch physician helped them defeat the <a href="/vampires/4015-55796/" data-ref-id="4015-55796">vampire</a>, following the plot of the novel <i>Dracula</i> by Bram Stoker, sans Harker, up to the end; instead of outright killing the undead beast, Abraham instead chose to bind the demon to his will and that of his descendants. Whether he knew that this assured Mina would never heal from her vampirism is debatable. However, he went forth and forced the vampire to undergo varied modifications which he oversaw while he lived, modifications that would eventually lead to Dracula being fully bound to the line and becoming their faithful servant against the monsters he once belonged to. In addition to this, Abraham presumably oversaw the inhuman increase in power the vampire received upon his forced servitude, including the massive upgrades in regeneration and shadow control he displayed in his future fights against <a href="/millennium/4060-45562/" data-ref-id="4060-45562">Millennium</a>.</p><p>Abraham Van Helsing, whose descendants would change surname to Hellsing and form the Hellsing Organization, was also presumably the first of the family to be awarded a seat at the Convention of Twelve. Nevertheless, his carelessness, or hubris, cost his family dearly; while <a href="/alucard/4005-44583/" data-ref-id="4005-44583">Alucard</a> was in effect bound to the bloodline, his survival also allowed <a href="/wilhelmina-murray/4005-22206/" data-ref-id="4005-22206">Mina Harker</a> to continue struggling through undeath as for as long as the master vampire roamed the night, she would know no eternal rest. Thence, a <a href="/nazism/4060-52436/" data-ref-id="4060-52436">Nazi</a> lunatic who ended up working for the secret Order 666 Projekt managed to dig up Mina's dessicated corpse, and use her undead systems to create the insane monster SHI, and the genesis of the Millennium Group, who would eventually end up brutally destroying <a href="/london/4020-55798/" data-ref-id="4020-55798">London</a> with their Army of a Thousand Vampires.</p><p>Alucard apparently had a deep, grudging respect for Abraham; he would eventually end up partly patterning his own appearance after Abraham's, reflecting how highly he thought of the doctor who had manged to best him in combat and drive a stake through his heart. He also compared the Vatican's greatest Paladin, <a href="/father-alexander-anderson/4005-44693/" data-ref-id="4005-44693">Alexander Anderson</a>, to him, favorably, believing earnestly Anderson's humanity and his own history with Abraham proved a human with a will powerful enough was capable of destroying monsters such as himself.

Donez, Walter ask Alucard why he has taken such a form and Alucard simply reply’s, “Forms mean nothing to me.” In this state the girl looks about nine years old and carries a tommy gun. This is probably due to the fact that the pistols had not been made for him yet, Walter is merely 15 years old and just as dangerous as Alucard.

This argument is later disproved when Alucard at the height of his power takes this from once again when facing the traitor Walter.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Alucard, being an immortal, has little regard for the lives of those he kills. He often fights with extreme cruelty, and could be labeled as a sociopath for his tendencies to torture his opponents. However, he holds a strict moral that only human beings can kill monsters as shown when he was fighting Father Anderson. He said that he'd gladly die fighting a human but quickly show disgust when Father Anderson pierced his heart with the Helena's nail, transforming him to a monster.</p><p>He's also very loyal to his master Integra wherein he hesitantly asks his master what to do next and obeys it without complaining.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-2285919" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109250/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg" data-ratio="1.6671428571429" data-width="700" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 700px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:166.7%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109250/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2285919"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" data-width="383" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/109250/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109250/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg 700w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/109250/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/109250/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg 383w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/109250/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109250/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg 700w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/109250/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/109250/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg 383w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" data-width="383"></noscript></a></figure><p>Alucard, like all vampires, requires blood to stay alive. However it is not shown in Hellsing as to wether what would happen if a vampire was not to drink blood. Seras Victoria tried to stay away from blood as much as possible during the first half of the manga and had no adverse effect whatsoever. Also, Alucard survivng 30 years without drinking blood can raise the speculations that Vampires do not require blood to survive but can be only be regarded as a craving. But it is still unclear whether Alucard survived because of his new found power.</p><h3>Super Strength</h3><p>Alucard can lift far in excess of 10 tons effortlessly. Upper limit unknown.</p><h3>Super Speed</h3><p>Alucard can move at teleportation-like speeds(faster than the speed of bullets).</p><h3>Superhuman Reflexes</h3><p>Alucard can catch objects moving at supersonic speeds with ease. He even caught Rip Van winkle's bullet(which traveled at Mach 3.5) and fought father Anderson multiple times to a standstill (both were moving faster than average vampires which usually dodges multiple machine gun fires).</p><h3>Superhuman Accuracy</h3><p>Alucard is very proficient in using guns. He has perfect aim and has taught Seras Victoria on how to shoot things more than a mile away without missing. He can also fire multiple bullets that does not miss without even looking.</p><h3>Super Stamina</h3><p>Alucard was never shown to tire and could continue fighting as long as he likes.</p><h3>Immortality</h3><p>Alucard does not age and as a vampire, he does not die. Also, he cannot be killed by any means necessary as he would only redirect the death to one of the souls he devoured. Father Anderson even said that the reason as to why Alucard can never be truly killed is because of all the souls he devoured. However, it is only a pseudo-immortality as he can probably be finally killed by destroying all the souls he released in Restraint Level 0 and by killing him.</p><p>Alucard also stated himself that he will not get weak to sunlight, he only dislikes it.</p><h3>Invulnerability</h3><p>Regular bullets, temperature extremes, bombs,etc. cannot harm Alucard to any degree. Despite his level of near invulnerability, Holy weapons can harm.</p><h3>Healing Factor</h3><p>Alucard can heal from any injury instantly without scarring including organs or missing limbs (when harmed by those who can match him in strength or holy weapons) If blown to bits he merely turns into a shadow and reforms.</p><h3>Vision Powers</h3><p>Alucard, like traditional vampires, possess enhanced sight, such as night vision (Alucard can see clearly in total darkness) and telescopic (can see events happening dozens of miles away as it happens).</p><h3>Telepathy</h3><p>Alucard can read the mind and communicate with anyone he so desires.</p><h3>Telekinesis</h3><p>Alucard can move objects with his mind. The upper limit of this power is unknown.</p><h3>Invisibility</h3><p>Alucard can turn invisible to the naked eye any time he so desires.</p><h3>Intangibility</h3><p>Alucard is capable of shifting his mass into another dimension, altering his density and thus allowing him to pass through any solid object, or allow solid objects to pass through him. This was shown when Alucard phased through a solid wall during the chapter where Seras Victoria was explaining that she was a vampire to the Wild Geese.</p><h3><b>Shapeshifting</b></h3><p>Alucard can turn into any form he chooses-from being able to turn different human beings to animals to even inanimate objects.</p><h3><b>Shadow Manipulation</b></h3><p>Alucard can turn into a shadowy form, which he can use however he wishes (turning into hellhounds,etc.).</p><h3><b>Mind Control</b></h3><p>Alucard has the ability to control the minds of any human, or vampire, he chooses (meaning he can control more than one mind simultaneously). The extent of this power is unknown.</p><h3><b>Sleep Induction</b></h3><p>Can cause someone to sleep by mere thought.</p><h3><b>Hypnosis</b></h3><p>Can send others into a dream-like state (both human and vampire).</p><h3><b>Illusions</b></h3><p>Can create false images in the minds of others (both human and vampire). As shown when he cast an illusion on Walter (making Alucard look like Luke Valentine).</p><h3><b>Bloodsucking</b></h3><p>Can absorb blood through his clothes or over large distances.</p><h3>Memory Absorption</h3><p>Can absorb memories through blood.</p><h3><b>Soul Devouring</b></h3><p>Owns the soul of whoever he kills.</p><h3>Control Art: System Restriction Level 0</h3><p>Alucard calls upon all the souls that he's devoured and summons them on the battle field to do as his bidding. The familiars that he has summoned have been stripped away of free will.</p><h3>Omnipresence</h3><p>When Alucard drank Schrodinger's blood, he had gained his powers. He can now also be everywhere and nowhere at the same time.</p><h3>Combat Experience</h3><p>Although Alucard prefers uses his vast supernatural powers to crush his opponents, Alucard has mastered all forms of armed and unarmed combat over his past life of 2,000 years.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-902075" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18154/902075-b8282a6ba8deac3a.jpg" data-ratio="0.32857142857143" data-width="140" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 140px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:32.9%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18154/902075-b8282a6ba8deac3a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-902075"><img alt="The Jackal" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 140px) 100vw, 140px" data-width="140" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18154/902075-b8282a6ba8deac3a.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18154/902075-b8282a6ba8deac3a.jpg 140w"><noscript><img alt="The Jackal" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18154/902075-b8282a6ba8deac3a.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18154/902075-b8282a6ba8deac3a.jpg 140w" sizes="(max-width: 140px) 100vw, 140px" data-width="140"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Jackal</figcaption></figure><p><b>The Jackal</b></p><p>A large black pistol made by Walter C.

Hellsing's Motto.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2> <b><u> History</u></b></h2>        Hellsing was written and illustrated by <a data-ref-id="4040-45909" href="/kouta-hirano/4040-45909/" slug="kouta-hirano">Kouta Hirnao</a> it was released in 1997 and published in Young Kings Outs and recently ended this year in September 08. It was taken and collected in a series of manga that span 9 issues.. It has also spanned into a prequel being made called Hellsing: The Dawn that follows <a data-ref-id="4005-44583" href="/alucard/4005-44583/" slug="alucard">Alucard</a> and <a data-ref-id="4005-44606" href="/walter-c-donez/4005-44606/" slug="walter-c-donez">Walter C Dornez</a>     in during the 2nd world war. Due to its growing popularity it soon became an Anime Series that was that followed its own plot. It spanned 13 episodes and was broadcast in October 2001 and finished in January 2002. An OVA was released after in January 2006 and follows the manga story line it is currently ongoing and has six episodes so far.release <br/> <br/><h2>BIO</h2><p>Great Britain, in the Hellsing Universe, despite strong appearances to the contrary, is still essentially ruled by a monarchy heavily supported by a group of twelve aristocrats, the Convention of Twelve, each commanding a section of the main power structure in the staunchly Protestant country. These seats are hereditary, and one of them is reserved for the heir of the <a data-ref-id="4005-62851" href="/abraham-van-helsing/4005-62851/" slug="abraham-van-helsing">Van Helsing</a> family, who have taken the name Hellsing. The Hellsing Family oversees matters concerning supernatural threats and their neutralization. Its founder, Abraham Van Helsing himself, and a group of adventurers, captured and subjugated the most powerful of all vampires, the ancient voivode of Wallachia, <a data-ref-id="4005-44583" href="/alucard/4005-44583/" slug="alucard">Dracula</a> himself. <br/></p> <p>This powerful undead was experimented upon, its powers enhanced to abominable levels, and used as a weapon to destroy Great Britain's supernatural enemies. It was renamed <a data-ref-id="4005-44583" href="/alucard/4005-44583/" slug="alucard">Alucard</a>, and bonded to the Van Helsing bloodline to obey as their servant. The first recorded usage of this living weapon came in WWII, when by orders of the then holder of the Hellsing title and manor, <a data-ref-id="4005-62850" href="/arthur-hellsing/4005-62850/" slug="arthur-hellsing">Sir Arthur Hellsing</a>, Alucard was deployed along with fellow Hellsing servant <a data-ref-id="4005-44606" href="/walter-c-donez/4005-44606/" slug="walter-c-donez">Walter C. Dornez</a>, to destroy the Nazi Order 666 camp and experiments, which dabbled in the creation of artificial vampires through different forms of surgery and serums. This mission would be successful, though with unforeseeable consequences for the Organization and London itself. This was mainly due to the strange survival of the three main Order 666 members, the Major, the Doctor and the Captain, who would move on to South America with great amounts of the stolen Nazi wealth and many followers, eventually founding the <a data-ref-id="4060-45562" href="/millennium/4060-45562/" slug="millennium">Millennium</a> Group.</p> <p>Alucard would be later sealed under Sir Arthur's orders, who believed he was "too strong a draught to be used more than the occasional medicine"; Walter would continue to serve the Hellsings as their butler and personal trashman. Upon Arthur's death, his brother, <a data-ref-id="4005-62854" href="/richard-hellsing/4005-62854/" slug="richard-hellsing">Richard</a>, hoped to be named heir to the title and manor, but Arthur had unexpectedly named his own young daughter, <a data-ref-id="4005-44614" href="/integral-fairbrook-wingates-hellsing/4005-44614/" slug="integral-fairbrook-wingates-hellsing">Integra</a>, as the successor. Enraged by this, Richard attempted to kill the girl, but, acting upon her father's orders upon emergency states, she snuck to the manor's dark cellars, and found the cell where the dessicated vampire still rested. Richard found her there and shot her, non-fatally. While he was moving in for the kill, the girl's blood powered up the vampire's corpse, and acting upon the commands to protect its master, it killed the men accompanying Richard, defended the young Integra, and allowed to execute her traitorous uncle.</p> <p>Eventually, Alucard returned to prominency upon the rise of artificial vampires on Great Britain; as the greatest anti-vampire agent, he was often used to deal with the threats. One night in 1998, Alucard sired a fledging, a former policewoman named <a data-ref-id="4005-45136" href="/seras-victoria/4005-45136/" slug="seras-victoria">Seras Victoria</a>, who had nearly died in the struggle against a vampire priest. The young Draculina was forced to incorporate into the organization and her status was reported as KIA. Alucard was forced to abide for his decision and guide her in the ways of vampirism. He was then drawn into a confrontation against the Hellsing Organization's Catholic opposite, the Vatican's own <a data-ref-id="4060-46183" href="/section-xiii-iscariot/4060-46183/" slug="section-xiii-iscariot">Section XIII</a>: Iscariot, and their own ace card: the Paladin <a data-ref-id="4005-44693" href="/father-alexander-anderson/4005-44693/" slug="father-alexander-anderson">Alexander Anderson</a>, upon attacking a target in Badrick, Ireland.<br/></p> <p>Shortly after, a strike team composed of two artificial vampires (<a data-ref-id="4005-45600" href="/jan-valentine/4005-45600/" slug="jan-valentine">Jan</a> and <a data-ref-id="4005-45593" href="/luke-valentine/4005-45593/" slug="luke-valentine">Luke Valentine</a>) and a large assembly or armored ghouls, soulless vampiric puppets, struck at the Organization's HQ during a Convention of Twelve meeting, and decimated the organization's ranks until only four active operatives survived: Walter, Integra, Alucard and Seras. Upon the destruction of the invading forces, the defenders heard from Jan Valentine's lips a single word, their sole lead on their attackers: Millennium. In seeking information, Iscariot, through means of its leader, Bishop <a data-ref-id="4005-47158" href="/enrico-maxwell/4005-47158/" slug="enrico-maxwell">Enrico Maxwell,</a> offered Hellsing a dossier containing information of the Millennium Group to pay the blood debt incurred in the Ireland incident, though Integra did not like Iscariot meddling in Great Britain and liked Maxwell even less because of his own chauvinist, arrogant and fanatical views. Because of the devastating attack against Hellsing's ranks, Dornez hired a huge force of mercenaries known as the Wild Geese to serve as their standing army, with Commander <a data-ref-id="4005-44756" href="/pip-bernadotte/4005-44756/" slug="pip-bernadotte">Pip Bernadotte</a> as direct leader under Integra's orders.<br/></p> <p>Hellsing then would move on against Millennium, seeking them in South America, starting on Rio de Janeiro. A Millennium operative, also an artificial vampire (<a data-ref-id="4005-50787" href="/tubalcain-alhambra/4005-50787/" slug="tubalcain-alhambra">Tubalcain Alhambra</a>) attacked them; he was promptly killed after a spectacular declaration of war against Millennium. While at a summit between the Convention, Hellsing and Iscariot, a Millennium envoy (<a data-ref-id="4005-48732" href="/schrodinger/4005-48732/" slug="schrodinger">Schrodinger</a>) reached past security and delivered a TV from the Major, who responded to the declaration of war and challenged all present to stop him. Not much later, another Millennium operative, a sharpshooter (Rip Van Winkle) moved in and captured a VTOL carrier near the English coast, the <i>Eagle</i>, surrendered by traitorous Englishmen, similarly vampirized.</p> <p><a data-ref-id="4005-46192" href="/rip-van-winkle/4005-46192/" slug="rip-van-winkle">Van Winkle</a> defended the ship against external attacks, but was ill-equipped to handle a kamikaze attack by Alucard, who reclaimed the warship at the cost of wrecking it. As Alucard could not cross the ocean without external means of locomotion, Millennium was poised for an attack on English soil. Thus, Hellsing lost its ace card, allowing Millennium to brutally level London with a barrage of missiles when the military and navy's communications were jammed and the Nazi zeppelins loomed over the city. Integra was forced to move through the destroyed city after leaving a defense commitee, and Walter left her to battle <a data-ref-id="4005-50786" href="/the-captain/4005-50786/" slug="the-captain">the Captain</a>; she would find Alexander Anderson and join his Iscariot batallion, as the armies of Christianity moved for another Crusade. Hellsing, the only local agency trained to deal with the threat, sealed itself and barricaded within the manor. Another Millennium operative (<a data-ref-id="4005-48733" href="/zorin-blitz/4005-48733/" slug="zorin-blitz">Zorin Blitz</a>) attacked the manor with a detachment of Millennium shocktroopers, but the zeppelin she commanded and the missiles it carried were destroyed by heavy  gunfire by Seras' Harkonnen II Field Dominance Weapons System, leaving Zorin with no option but to command ground invasion of the manor, aided by her illusory powers. There, because of her sadism and hubris, she committed several critical mistakes, including leaving Seras alive after a brutal beating, giving her the chance to finally accept her heritage (she had previously refused to drink blood) and drain the recently deceased Captain Bernadotte, absorbing his soul and becoming a full vampire.</p> <p>With regenerated strength, Seras all but shredded Zorin's men, saving the few Geese still standing, and then moved in to execute Blitz. She then used her new powers to manifest a shadow-matter wing and flew to downtown London to defend Integra from the Iscariot priests she had been forced to travel with for protection, who were ready to act upon Maxwell's orders and apprehend her, at the immense fury of Paladin Anderson, who objected such a measure, knowing full well Maxwell intended to settle a silly vendetta at the cost of the lives of countless Englishmen. Alucard, meanwhile, had manifested shadow-matter sails for the <i>Eagle</i>, enveloped the warship in a bank of mist and crashed right into the battle of the Christian armies against Millennium forces. Alucard then manifested the entirety of all the familiars he had ever absorbed, adding countless warriors to the fight for England; these were considered the Army of Hellsing, along with Integra and Seras. Alucard would then confront in sucession a divinely empowered form of Anderson and a vampirized Walter; the main result of these encointers was the virtual destruction of Iscariot. Meanwhile, Seras and Integra fought the last of the Major's forces and ultimately destroyed the Millennium threat by killing the remaining vampire Nazis and the Captain. <br/></p> <p>On his side, Alucard defeated Walter and started drinking the blood from all of London. This was "poisoned" with Schrodinger's blood, making him fade out of existence due to the nature of the powers of the catboy. The last to die were Walter and the Doctor, leaving the Hellsing Organization down to a few Geese guarding the ruins of the manor, Seras and Integra. Thirty years later, Integra would remark she believed the institution would die with her, shortly before Alucard's return.<br/></p>Current Roster  <ul class="plain-list"> <li>Sir Integral Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing (Possible last leader)</li> <li>Alucard (Returned after thirty years after the Battle of London, mostly depowered)<br/></li> <li>Seras Victoria (Standing vampire of the Hellsing Organization)<br/></li> <li>Pip Bernadotte and The Wild Geese (Deceased during Zorin Blitz's attack against Hellsing Manor and blood and soul offered to Seras; all but three operatives KIA)</li></ul>]]></description><first_appeared_in_issue><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-251482/]]></api_detail_url><id>251482</id><name><![CDATA[Vol. 1]]></name><issue_number>1</issue_number></first_appeared_in_issue><id>44615</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/132759-196613-hellsing.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/132759-196613-hellsing.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/132759-196613-hellsing.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/132759-196613-hellsing.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/132759-196613-hellsing.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/132759-196613-hellsing.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/132759-196613-hellsing.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Hellsing]]></name><publisher><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/publisher/4010-2814/]]></api_detail_url><id>2814</id><name><![CDATA[Shōnen Gahōsha]]></name></publisher><site_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/hellsing/4060-44615/]]></site_detail_url><resource_type><![CDATA[team]]></resource_type></team><episode><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/episode/4070-1516/]]></api_detail_url><air_date/><date_added>2013-09-27 14:36:40</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-09-27 10:12:58</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Integra faces the Major, Seras faces the Captain, and Alucard faces Walter.
