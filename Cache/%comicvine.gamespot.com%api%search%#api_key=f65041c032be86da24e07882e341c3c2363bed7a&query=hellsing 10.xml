A man of many vices and many indiscretions, who nonetheless managed to increase the Hellsing Organization's influence beyond its primitive scope and allow for further expansion. Educated at Balliol College as a descendant of Abraham van Helsing, he was assigned a young butler who had also spent some time in that school: Walter C. Dornez. Arthur, during WWII, developed a severe case of borderline alcoholism and unquenchable lust for carnal pleasures, and with the influence he commanded, he very rarely denied himself these desires. Despite this, he held a firm hand upon the estate's resources, and was eventually entrusted with the family seat at the Convention of Twelve and the knowledge of the loyal Nosferatu sworn to obey his orders without question. Catankerous and outspoken, he never feared voicing his opinion without remorse or concern. His main friends, through all his life, were Sir Hugh Irons and Sir Shelby Penwood, both of who held similar chairs in the Convention of Twelve. Their group was thus a formidable power source in the British Empire of WWII.</p><p>Midway through WWII, Arthur and his friends started receiving accumulating rumors of horrors unspoken in a Polish camp where a mysterious Projekt, Order 666, had been issued. Words of secret experiments and undead monsters became serious enough to convince the trio to authorize the deployment of a higher class of weapon to combat the burgeoning threat: the Hellsing monster. Pairing him with Dornez, Arthur ensured the destruction of the camp though he was unaware of a mysterious circumstance, as of yet unrevealed, that allowed for the Projekt main three figures, the Major, the Captain and the Doctor, to survive the carnage virtually unscathed, a circumstance that had much to do with Walter. Some time later, he grew weary of Alucard, believing him too strong a weapon to be solely relied upon, and had him sealed and any records of his existence cloaked or destroyed to continue the Organization's work through more conventional soldiers. He retained Dornez as a butler and eventually promoted him to retainer of the family.</p><p>Eventually, he somehow found a woman who he found good enough to become his wife, and sired a single daughter, Integra. His brother Richard tolerated his excesses in the hopes of reaching the power Arthur enjoyed. His wife died before Integra was twelve, and eventually his lifestyle caught up with him and caused to start slipping into a deep sickness. He revealed to Integra in hushed tones about Alucard's existence and resting place, and tried to ensure his power was passed down to her. Richard found this unbearable and attempted to kill her only to set in motion the events that led to the genesis of the <i>Hellsing </i>manga.</p><p>By all means, Richard was not a perfect man. Obnoxious, drunk, loud and outspoken, not many liked the odd Hellsing heir. Even his close friend Sir Shelby Penwood would later admit to Integra he found himself occasionally fastidiated by Arthur's now and then over-the-top demands for weapons, alcohol and fun, and while Sir Hugh Irons recognized him as a great man, he also commented he had been a fool for trusting Walter, foreshadowing his role in the Final Night of London.</p>]]></description><first_appeared_in_issue><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-251482/]]></api_detail_url><id>251482</id><name><![CDATA[Vol. 1]]></name><issue_number>1</issue_number></first_appeared_in_issue><gender>1</gender><id>62850</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/839243-54765_2223049587_bfda73c731_thumb.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/839243-54765_2223049587_bfda73c731_thumb.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/839243-54765_2223049587_bfda73c731_thumb.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/839243-54765_2223049587_bfda73c731_thumb.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/839243-54765_2223049587_bfda73c731_thumb.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/839243-54765_2223049587_bfda73c731_thumb.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/839243-54765_2223049587_bfda73c731_thumb.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Arthur Hellsing]]></name><origin/><publisher><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/publisher/4010-2814/]]></api_detail_url><id>2814</id><name><![CDATA[Shōnen Gahōsha]]></name></publisher><real_name/><site_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/arthur-hellsing/4005-62850/]]></site_detail_url><resource_type><![CDATA[character]]></resource_type></character><character><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/character/4005-112067/]]></api_detail_url><birth/><count_of_issue_appearances>0</count_of_issue_appearances><date_added>2015-01-10 21:13:47</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-01-10 21:13:48</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Butler to the Alucard Vampire clan and one of the Six Heroes of Blazblue]]></deck><description/><first_appeared_in_issue/><gender>0</gender><id>112067</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/4322565-latest-26.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/4322565-latest-26.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/4322565-latest-26.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/4322565-latest-26.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/4322565-latest-26.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/4322565-latest-26.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/4322565-latest-26.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Valkenhayn R.

When summer vacation started Ben with on a road trip with his Grandfather <a href="../../maxwell-tennyson/29-49095/" rel="nofollow">Max Tennyson</a> and his cousin <a href="../../gwen-tennyson/29-55806/" rel="nofollow">Gwendolyn Tennyson</a>. Meanwhile a ship being piloted by an <a href="../../aliens/12-46567/" rel="nofollow">alien</a> named <a href="../../xylene/29-50332/" rel="nofollow">Xylene</a> was being attacked by another alien being named <a href="../../vilgax/29-50107/" rel="nofollow">Vilgax</a>. Xylene was carrying an alien device called the <a href="../../omnitrix/18-53930/" rel="nofollow">Omnitrix, a</a>lthough we do not learn of Xylene's involvement with the Omnitrix until season 2. The Omnitrix has the power to turn any being into any other type pf life form who’s DNA is stored inside it. Xylene was forced to send the Omnitrix and herself down to Earth in an escape pod. She sent the Omnitrix to Earth but she was attacked getting into her own pond and wound up going to the arctic where she went into hibernation. Ben found the pod, once he did the Omnitrix latched onto his wrist and he couldn’t get it off. While trying to take it off he accidentally transformed into a fire powered alien he would name <a href="../../heatblast/29-53895/" rel="nofollow">Heatblast</a>. After starting a fire by accident he told Max and Gwen what happen and Max (suspiciously) said he was an alien. While Ben was wondering how to turn back into a human the Omnitrix began to flash red and beep. He was soon turned back into his human form. Meanwhile, the heavily injured Vilgax is forced to spend some time in his regeneration pod to recover. He sends one of his robot probes to follow the last trace of the Omnitrix and retrieve it.</p><p>Back on Earth, Ben was playing with the Omnitrix and had become a giant dog-like creature. This form had no eyes but could see using echolocation and was agile and strong. Ben was soon attacked by the probes and he destroyed some but was about to be killed after he turned back human if not for Gwen beating it with a stick. Vilgax then sent a giant robot drone after Ben and it began attacking a trailer park. Ben then became a crystal like humanoid that was invulnerable and can turn its body it crystal like weapons. Ben would soon meet many enemies going on the road such as Doctor Animo, a mad geneticist who creates mutated animals and wants to take over the world, the Circus Freak Trio, Sixsix and more. Ben later meet a young mutant sociopath named <a href="../../kevin-11/29-49872/" rel="nofollow">Kevin 11</a>. Kevin has the power to absorb different types of energy and use it as he sees fit. At first Ben and Kevin got along but Ben soon saw Kevin’s true side and during a fight Kevin found he could absorb the energy of the Omnitrix and partially become some of the alien life forms in the Omnitrix. Kevin was going to use his power to get revenge on some kids who bothered him but was stopped by Ben. Kevin tried to steal more of the Omnitrix’s power but couldn’t handle it and was blasted into a bridge that collapsed on top of him. He did survive however and had absorbed the powers of the watch. Gwen also had fun as a hero ( <a href="../../lucky-girl/29-48500/" rel="nofollow">Lucky Girl</a>) when she came across one of the Charms of Bezel, which gave her the power of incredibly good luck and first meet recurring villain <a href="../../hex/29-50139/" rel="nofollow">Hex</a> who wanted all of the charms. Gwen was forced to destroy them however so Hex couldn’t have them. During one adventure were Ben was stuck in his Grey Matter form he was captured by an alien hunting nerd named</p><p>Howell Wayneright. Wayneright had intended to hand Ben over a group called The Forever Knights and their leader Enoch. Grandpa and Gwen tracked Ben down and with some help from the reformed Wayneright were able to free Ben. The Forever Knights would become recurring villains in the series. Ben would battle many more aliens until Vilgax appeared on Earth in a new stronger body while the gang was in <a href="../../washington-dc/34-55685/" rel="nofollow">Washington D.C.</a> Grandpa was acting suspicious the whole time and trying to keep Ben from fighting Ben would still battle some of Vilgax’s drones until he fought Vilgax himself. Vilgax was too strong for Ben and showed that he new a great many of the Omnitrix’s secrets, as he was able to turn Ben back into a human. Vilgax was angered that a child was giving him so much trouble. Vilgax captures Ben and Grandpa and Gwen enter a secret lair in Mount Rushmore to gather weapons to free Ben. Ben and his family defeat Vilgax and Ben tells grandpa he has some questions.</p><h2>Revelations</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2304991-ben10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2304991" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.1153846153846" data-width="364" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 364px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:111.5%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2304991-ben10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2304991"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2304991-ben10.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2304991-ben10.jpg 364w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px" data-width="573"></a></figure><p>Grandpa reveals that he was once part of a group called the <a href="../../plumbers/65-57527/" rel="nofollow">Plumbers</a>. They were an agency that fought against alien and supernatural forces and that Vilgax was and old enemy of his. They also meet and old Plumber friend of Max’s he has been setting the aliens that they Plumbers captured free so he can make a profit of there recapture. He was accidentally trapped in the Null Void, which is another dimension that Plumbers sent their prisoners to. Ben’s aliens are soon seen all over the country reeking havoc and stealing what ever they pleas. It turns out to be Kevin who has gain the power to turn any to any one of Ben’s aliens without the Omnitrix for however long he wants but he can’t change back and blames Ben for his condition. Because of the things Kevin has done Ben’s aliens are being hunted by soldiers being lead by Lieutenant Steel. Kevin soon turns into and an amalgam of all of Ben’s aliens and can’t turn back into his human self at all or there individual forms. He is soon shot off a bridge by an energy cannon fired by Steel’s men and falls into the ocean. Ben also gains a new alien he names Cannonbolt that can roll into a super hard ball that can spin incredibly fast when fighting a giant tick monster trying to drain Earth of its’ life force. This new form is essential for it’s defeat as Ben destroyed the Tick from the inside. Kevin later appears alive and well. He attacks Ben but isn’t quite as effective as even though he has all ten of Ben’s powers plus his own, Ben describes them as being only one tenth the strength of his powers. The two are soon captured by an alien named Slix Vigma who captures different species and makes them fight. The two are forced to team up but soon are at odds once they defeat their Slix who turns out to be a robot that is one with the whole ship they are on. After they defeat Vigma and many of the other prisoners escape Kevin turns on Ben. Ben transforms into Cannonbolt because Kevin has seen him and doesn’t know how his powers work. Ben is also helped by Technorg another alien who Ben saved from Kevin and helps Ben due to a code of honor. As Ben escapes Technorg stays with Kevin intending to make their stay on the ship as painful as possible. Ben would soon meet a group of alien heroes called The <a href="../../galactic-enforcers/65-55861/" rel="nofollow">Galactic Enforcers</a> when they helped him stop Sixsix and his new ally Vulkanus. He would transform into a new alien called <a href="../../wildvine/29-70933/" rel="nofollow">Wildvine</a> when battling an evil giant fungus. The gang would also fight The Forever Knights again when they tried to find an ancient powerful sword called the Sword of Ekchuah. Max becomes obsessed with finding the sword, but is relieved when he sees that the sword has become brittle and became dust once taken from its resting place. Gwen would also become Lucky Girl again after finding the Keystone of Bezel, which increased her natural abilities. She also fought Hex and his niece <a href="../../charmcaster/29-49094/" rel="nofollow">Charmcaster</a>. Hex wanted to use the keystone to bring back the other charms, but was stopped by Gwen, Ben and Grandpa. Ben would soon lose control of his alien form of <a href="../../ghostfreak/29-53370/" rel="nofollow">Ghostfreak</a>. Ghostfreak revealed that his species' consciousness lives in every piece of DNA and that he was trapped in the Omnitrix and wanted out. Once escaped he took on his true form but was revealed to be weak against sunlight and needed to merge with Ben to fix that. He used the Freakshow Trio to try and do it, but was destroyed by Ben. Kevin would soon return to Earth after finding Vilgax frozen in ice in space. Meanwhile Ben had accidentally activated a master control on the Omnitrix that allowed him to be any of his forms with a thought, could go to one form to the next, and wasn’t timing out. Ben was giving the two of them a hard time, but grandpa didn’t think he could stop the two soon he went to get the Null Void projector which he kept with him after they left D.C. He tried to trap the two in the Null Void, but Ben got sucked along as well and it was up to Gwen to save him. Vilgax took her and Ben gave him the Omnitrix, but not before Ben reset it back to the way it was, but Vilgax assured him he could reset the control, but was double-crossed by Kevin. However Ben and Gwen was able to leave the two trapped in the Null Void and brought the Omnitrix out with them.</p><h2>Back To The Future</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png" data-ref-id="1300-2548042" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75555555555556" data-width="720" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 720px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.6%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png" data-ref-id="1300-2548042"><img alt="Ben 10,000" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png 720w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png 320w"><noscript><img alt="Ben 10,000" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png 720w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ben 10,000</figcaption></figure><p>Ben and Gwen soon meet future versions of themselves from twenty years.

Ben stops the mummy, but not before absorbing its DNA into the Omnitrix. The Tennysons soon find out that a space shuttle has been delayed due to purple lightning, the same kind that appeared when the werewolf and mummy showed up. They soon find that the alien werewolf has freed the mummy and that they are working with an evil alien version of Frankenstein named Viktor and that their plan is to resurrect their true leader, Ghostfreak. After bringing back Ghostfreak the Tennysons find out that Ghostfreak plans to use the Corrodium to block out the sun and mutate the Earth so he can rule. However after absorbing Viktor’s DNA the family is able to stop Ghostfreak’s plan and destroy him once again by exposing him to sunlight while they were in space.

Its activation alerts Tetrax (known as Hoverboard in "Hunted"), who travels to Earth in order to retrieve Ben. He explains the situation to Ben, who hasn't figured out the meaning of the countdown. He leaves Gwen and Grandpa Max behind, not wanting the latter to be recognized during their trip. Gwen sneaks on board anyway.</p><p>Using the advanced medical equipment on board his ship, Tetrax finds the DNA signature of the Omnitrix's creator, Azmuth, and tracks him to a prison facility called Incarcecon. After staging a breakout, they free a female Chimera Sui Generis (Vilgax's species) named Myaxx, who is Azmuth's assistant. She switched her DNA signature for Azmuth's when he refused to give her credit for helping to create the Omnitrix. He also refused to give her the abort sequence for the self-destruct, which as she explains will not only kill Ben, but most of the universe's inhabitants; including Earth itself. Regardless, Myaxx knows how to find Azmuth, and leads them to his home planet.</p><p>While attempting to reach Azmuth, they are attacked by Vilgax, who has somehow escaped the Null Void and has commandeered a ship to track down Ben. Ben is ultimately successful in repelling the attack, though the pilot, a slime alien named Gluto, is killed in the conflict. Tetrax's ship crashes on Azmuth's home world. As they enter his mountain fortress, they are attacked by a group of Florauna which apparently eat Gwen, something Ben doesn't take too well. As Ben proceeds with the other two aliens down towards Azmuth's lair, Tetrax empathizes with Ben, revealing his origins of how working for Vilgax cost him his whole planet and everyone he's ever cared for. Tracking down Azmuth to a sealed secondary laboratory, Ben asks him to shut down the Omnitrix, but he refuses. As far as he's concerned, the universe deserves its fate for misusing his creation, which he explains was meant to help understand the various species in the universe, not turn them into weapons. Angry, Ben breaks down the wall with Cannonbolt and attacks him, revealing Azmuth to be an old, curmudgeonly Galvan hiding inside a large mechanical suit.</p><p>Vilgax, having recovered from his earlier defeat, leads a massive attack on Azmuth's mountain fortress. Gwen is revealed to have survived, Gluto having regenerated from some leftover material that splashed on her clothes and subsequently helped her to escape, which causes Ben to break down in tears and embrace her in a hug. Ben's actions during the battle renew Azmuth's faith in the universe, so he repairs the Omnitrix and gives Ben a brand-new form to use: Way Big, a skyscraper-sized alien modeled after tokusatsu superheroes. He easily repels Vilgax's army of drones and tosses the villain into space.</p><p>With the threat over, Ben offers to return the Omnitrix to Azmuth, since it does belong to him. Azmuth, however, sees Ben as the best place for the Omnitrix to be, both because he is technically fulfilling its original intention and because the Omnitrix attracts trouble simply by virtue of its existence. Tetrax returns Ben and Gwen to Earth, leaving Ben with a new hoverboard to replace the one Ben destroyed during his battle with Animo. Ben suggests taking a trip to the mall to please Gwen, but an announcement about the mall being attacked by zombies disrupts the occasion. Gwen simply states that this is a normal day for them and they all head off.</p><h2>Race Against Time</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548039-220px_ben_10_race_against_time_poster.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2548039" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.5" data-width="220" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 220px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:150.0%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548039-220px_ben_10_race_against_time_poster.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2548039"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" data-width="220" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548039-220px_ben_10_race_against_time_poster.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548039-220px_ben_10_race_against_time_poster.jpg 220w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548039-220px_ben_10_race_against_time_poster.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548039-220px_ben_10_race_against_time_poster.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" data-width="220"></noscript></a></figure><p>In Bellwood, a mysterious figure teleports into town, and immediately starts destroying things. Ben Tennyson , in the form of Heatblast, confronts him. After a short battle, Ben seemingly obliterates the villain. The next day, Ben goes back to school, and has trouble adjusting to normal life again. After a bad day, he and Gwen Tennyson go over some yearbook photos she took. In the background of one with Ben, Gwen enhances a blurred spot and reveals the same villain Ben defeated earlier. Max Tennyson identifies him as Eon , an alien the Plumbers captured almost two centuries ago. When he arrived, he was half dead and brought a device with him called the Hands of Armageddon, which would open a time rift to the alien's home dimension and unleash his race upon Earth if activated. They travel to the containment facility where Eon is supposed to be kept, only to find it empty and his guardian aged to near-death.</p><p>Traveling back to Bellwood, Max takes Ben and Gwen to the location of the Hands of Armageddon, guarded by the few remaining Plumbers including Principal White and other people Ben and Gwen known. Eon has them followed and breaks into the facility, but cannot activate the device. When Ben attempts to use the Omnitrix, it malfunctions, glowing and refusing to activate. Eon attempts to kidnap Ben, claiming it to be a rescue, but Ben escapes. Eon manages to corner Ben, explaining that his race learned to control time itself, but trapped themselves by misusing their power. He claims that his fate is intertwined with Ben's. Eon is scared off by an old man who happens to be another Plumber before he can elaborate. Grandpa Max decides it would be best for Ben to leave Bellwood so that Eon won't find him, but Ben bravely refuses and they both come to a deal where Ben will be monitored daily by a Plumber in disguise.</p><p>The Plumbers, all around town, guard Ben around the clock. When Ben goes to the school gym to be alone, Principal White attempts to calm Ben's fears just when Eon arrives again and shoves White out of the way. This time, Ben is able to become Diamondhead and fight him off. Later on that day, Ben decides to lure Eon into a trap by purposefully leaving himself open, but this backfires and he is captured along with Gwen and Max.</p><p>At the Plumber facility storing the Hands of Armageddon, Eon explains some of the background of the Omnitrix: Ben can only remain in his alien forms for ten minutes at a time, a failsafe to prevent them from overwhelming his personality. Eon knows how to deactivate the failsafe, and in doing so can resurrect himself through the Omnitrix. He does so, and Ben is transformed into a younger version of Eon. The older one retreats since there are now two of him. Reborn, Eon activates the Hands of Armageddon. Gwen and Max manage to free themselves and work to stop him. While Max tries to disable the time rift, potentially at the cost of his own life, Gwen appeals to Ben inside Eon. Ben successfully overcomes Eon, and with the help of the other Plumbers manages to save Max and disable the time rift, sending Eon's race back to their own dimension.</p><p>Just when it seems like they've won, time stops for everyone but Ben. The older Eon reappears, angered at Ben's victory. Ben transforms into Wildmutt and fights him off, eventually knocking him into the Hands of Armageddon, destroying them both. After doing an impromptu magic trick for the school talent show, using Wildmutt's timely de-transformation and a well placed stage curtain, Ben finally accepts being just Ben for a while. However, Max points out that aliens are persistent, and as the film ends an alien ship flies towards Earth.</p><h2><b>Alien Force</b></h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543042-ben10alienforce.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2543042" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.0457516339869" data-width="306" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 306px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:104.6%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543042-ben10alienforce.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2543042"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px" data-width="306" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543042-ben10alienforce.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543042-ben10alienforce.jpg 306w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543042-ben10alienforce.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543042-ben10alienforce.jpg 306w" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px" data-width="306"></noscript></a></figure><p>It has been five years since Ben has used the Omnitrix. He has become a normal teenager, dealing with Girls, sports and school. He goes to Grandpa Max to show him a new medal that he got playing soccer. He walks into the new Rust Bucket, finding it wrecked. He looks around to find a DNAlien (Human/Alien hybrid) prowling around the Rust Bucket. Ben fights him off (without the Omnitrix) and finds a message from Grandpa Max. With the fear that Max is in danger, Ben puts the Omnitrix back on. He and Gwen find Kevin making a deal with the DNAliens and the Forever Knights. Magister Labrid steps in and talks to them about the Highbreed, who think they are better than everyone else. In the fight against the Highbreed, Magister Labrid is killed and tells them that they need to work together to win. Ben, Gwen and Kevin set off to find Grandpa Max finding clues that he has left for them. Ben and Kevin have their problems (mainly when Kevin takes the Rust Bucket.) But Ben and Kevin settle their differences.</p><p>The recent message from Max was to locate the Plumbers' Kids (via the Plumber Badges.) Kevin has one of these badges which hints that he is a Plumber's kid. Ben encounters an alien named Albedo, who claims he is the true creator of the Omnitrix and he needs Ben's Omnitrix to override his own Omnitrix since he got stuck in a clone Ben form (but they look different). Ben and Albedo clash until Azmuth arrives stating Albedo was an assistant. Albedo is then sent off to the Null Void prison after Azmuth removes his central core.</p><p>Ben assembles a team made up of Cooper, Azmuth, Albright, Darkstar, Julie and Ship and Paradox along with Kevin and Gwen to stop the Highbreed's take over. Ben and his team successfully defeat the Highbreed, and as a result Ben becomes famous all throughout the Galaxy. Vilgax returned upon hearing of this and challenged Ben to a fight. Ben accepted. In order to fight Vilgax, Ben tried to hack the Omnitrix's master control, which caused a feedback pulse and a release of a few aliens which Ben recaptured. The feedback pulse also transformed Kevin into a living being of different elements. Ben eventually defeated Vilgax and his team went on various missions afterwards.</p><p>Ben is eventually confronted by a combined team of Vilgax and Albedo who had the Ultimatrix. Ben destroys the Omnitrix and gets the Ultimatrix from Albedo so he can fight Vilgax, Ben goes ultimate for the first time using Swampfire and he defeats his long time arch nemesis.</p><h2>Ultimate Alien</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543041-ben10_ultimate_alien_wp3_1900x1200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2543041" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.63157894736842" data-width="1900" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1900px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:63.2%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543041-ben10_ultimate_alien_wp3_1900x1200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2543041"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2543041-ben10_ultimate_alien_wp3_1900x1200.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543041-ben10_ultimate_alien_wp3_1900x1200.jpg 1900w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/9/93477/2543041-ben10_ultimate_alien_wp3_1900x1200.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2543041-ben10_ultimate_alien_wp3_1900x1200.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2543041-ben10_ultimate_alien_wp3_1900x1200.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2543041-ben10_ultimate_alien_wp3_1900x1200.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543041-ben10_ultimate_alien_wp3_1900x1200.jpg 1900w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/9/93477/2543041-ben10_ultimate_alien_wp3_1900x1200.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2543041-ben10_ultimate_alien_wp3_1900x1200.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2543041-ben10_ultimate_alien_wp3_1900x1200.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a></figure><p>One year has passed since Alien Force, Ben is now 16 and he is quite famous. He shares a deeper bond with Julie and has become better friends with Kevin. Ben now has a car. Ben battles a news reporter named William Harangue. A new alien enemy named Aggregor appears. He is an Osmosian like Kevin and he wishes to find the Map of Infinity and he absorbs the power of 5 aliens which Ben has tried to save. Aggregor continuously seems to trump Ben and inside the Forge of Creation, Ben is defeated. It is Kevin who absorbs Ben's powers and he defeats Aggregor, but this turns Kevin insane and he leaves. Ben and Gwen continue on a task to find Kevin, Ben and Kevin eventually clash but it is Ben who defeats Kevin and along with Cooper and Morningstar's help, they cure Kevin.</p><p>Ben encounters Eon once again and with the help of Ben 10,000 they defeat Eon. Ben is warned by Paradox to beware of Old George (who is St George, one who has had many stories told about him, as well as the founder of the Forever Knights). Ben is now in a fight against the Forever Knights once again. Ben has gone on several other missions. Ben has saved the Arachnichimp home world from a DNAlien-possessed Arachnichimp named Mizaru. He encountered Albedo again who was using his fame to make a theater-like show to gain money and try to fix himself out of Ben's form. He fought a few Ultimate Aliens in his watch who developed into sentient beings instead of the blank slates like they should be. He fought Generator Rex and had a few more encounters with the Forever Knights. Ben discovered Vilgax is alive and is mistaken for a false god named Diagon and is housed by a group called the Esoterica. Diagon abducted Vilgax who stole Old George's power to try and regain his own power, but Old George got the power back upon touching his sword. Now Ben is set to encounter Diagon if Old George fails. If Old George is to fall in battle then Ben will take Old George's sword which was an artifact made by Azmuth centuries ago, and must defeat Diagon.</p><h3>Generator Rex</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png" data-ref-id="1300-2543040" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56258992805755" data-width="695" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 695px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png" data-ref-id="1300-2543040"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png 695w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png 320w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png 695w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a></figure><p>According to Ben, he was at a celebrity gig when a strange storm picked him up and dumped him into Rex's world, where he mistook Rex for an alien attempting to destroy Bellwood. However, he was also mistaken for an EVO, who Rex tried to cure, but both found that they were not what the other thought they were. "Captured", Ben was taken back to Rex's with an unconscious Agent Six following a battle with an unknown enemy he had been chasing through the storm. While in the base, Ben learned of what was going on in that world, becoming confused by some facts, but generally grasping things are not going good. Deciding to team up with Rex, Ben met Caesar, Rex' brother and learned that he had banished the Alpha nanite to the null void, thinking it was an empty dimension. However, Alpha had returned and planned to use the Ultimatrix's energies to upgrade itself into a perfect being; Ben turned into Upgrade and fused with Rex, allowing them to use more powerful versions of Rex's weapons to beat down Alpha. With Caesar's help, Ben entered the Null Void as a stop on the way back home.</p><h2>Omniverse</h2><figure data-ref-id="1300-3851000" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65067/3851000-ben+10+%283%29.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.8274111675127" data-width="394" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 394px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:182.7%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65067/3851000-ben+10+%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-3851000"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" data-width="350" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/65067/3851000-ben+10+%283%29.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65067/3851000-ben+10+%283%29.jpg 394w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/65067/3851000-ben+10+%283%29.jpg 350w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/65067/3851000-ben+10+%283%29.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65067/3851000-ben+10+%283%29.jpg 394w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/65067/3851000-ben+10+%283%29.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" data-width="350"></noscript></a></figure><p>In this series Ben has a new Omnitrix an a new alien partner Rook Blonko. Gwen has gone to college and Kevin has joined her so then Ben wanted to go solo. He soon learns of an alien protection racked in Bellwood so he attempts to do something about it. He goes to Mr. Baumann's store and learns that aliens are using what are called "shake down devices" to level establishments that don't pay. It's there that Ben meets his new alien partner and manage to save Baumann's store, but not before destroying some of it. Rook and Ben who is hesitant to take on a new partner soon chase them to a place called Undertown. It's an entire secret city of aliens under Bellwood. The culprit behind this is revealed to be Vilgax's former lackey Psyphon. Along the way though Ben encounters old foes as well as some new ones like the hunter called Khyber, Dr. Psychobos who is a mutant version of the alien species, Ben calls Brainstorm, but it is revealed Ben had a rogue Galvanic Mechamorph called Malware for an enemy.</p><p> </p><p>He was responsible for destroying one of Ben's most prized transformations, Feedback. Many of Ben's older aliens like Stinkfly and Greymatter return. The Halloween Trio get names: Benwolf becomes Blitzwolfer, Benmummy becomes Snare-Oh, and Benviktor becomes Frankenstrike. However Ben also unlocked new aliens like Shocksquatch, Crashhopper, and Gravattack. Also many fan favorite villains from many different series have returned like Dr. Animo, Albedo, and Vilgax, but also Zs'Skayr and Doctor Viktor returned.</p><p> </p><p>In the episode "So Long and Thanks for All the Smoothies", the universe is destroyed and so then Ben as Alien X simply builds another universe that was just like the old one. Another major storyline is that Earth was taken over by the Incursean Empire. Ben was defeated and exiled into space where his sentence was death, but he had an unlikely ally. Azmuth also gave him his Incursean transformation which allowed him to return to Earth and save it thus ending the Incursean rule and saving Earth yet again. When Albedo returned he recreated the Ultimatrix and attempted to take over the universe by stealing Azmuth's intelligence, but he was stopped. Gwen and Kevin do make occasional appearances now, but they are simply minor recurring characters now. Max Tennyson is a part of Ben's team again and has been in nearly every episode.</p><h2>Alternate Universe Versions</h2><p>There is one universe, featured in the episode titled <a href="https://www.comicvine.com/ben-10-204-gwen-10/4070-6514/" data-ref-id="4070-6514">Gwen 10</a> in which Ben never gets the Omnitrix.

He also sports 4 green crystal points on his back and has a sharp head. He has an overall square body design. His eyes are yellow in color, and his Omnitrix/Ultimatrix symbol is on the left of his chest. His name is derived from diamond, a super hard substance originated from coal and "head" the top of his body.</p><p>Diamondhead's species have super dense bodies which are composed of extremely dense organic green and purple crystals, making him nearly invulnerable. He is able to manipulate the atomic structure of his crystalline structure and physiology at will, thus allowing him to make crude crystal weapons from any part of his body on demand, and fire crystals rapidly from his hands. He can make huge clusters of crystals, by creating crystal shields, and even make ramps for himself to jump on. In certain ways, he can even reshape his projectiles into certain shapes and can make giant body parts like hands to capture enemies. His crystalkinetic powers don't end there, as he can control the crystals that are not even connected to his body redirecting them. The same ability also allows him to regenerate to a limited extent, such as growing severed or lost limbs. In addition to growing crystals on himself, he can also grow them over other objects. In addition, to his crystalkinetic powers his crystal body itself acts as a living prism, making lasers and weapons similar useless refracting the beams. He also has proved strong enough to easily beat Kevin, defeat Vilgax.</p><p><b>XLR8</b><b>:</b> XLR8 is a Kineceleran that resembles a semi-armored velociraptor.

His appearance can also bring fear in the hearts of others, sometimes, even Ben is creeped out. Ghostfreak can also peel back his own skin, which reveals a horrifying mass of tentacles, which is seen in The Big Tick and Last Laugh.

His tentacles, hidden underneath the first form, are revealed. Spikes grew on his shoulders and through one half of his arms. In this form, Ghostfreak now has claws instead of hands. The skin he had in his Omnitrix form is presumably a safety feature incorporated by the Omnitrix's creator, Azmuth, both to safeguard this alien forms exposure to sunlight and to lessen the frightful impact of its true hideous appearance. This is substantiated by the fact that Ghostfreak willingly ripped it off, despite it being daylight at the time, in order to reveal his true appearance; the true nature of this skin, however, is never fully explained in the series beyond its sun-shielding capabilities.</p><p>Ghostfreaks original powers were limited to intangibility and invisibility (accompanied by a inverted color scheme and transparency). It has been explained that he can control his density. He has been shown to be able to change into a smoke like form in Hunted. Ghostfreak can also peel back his own skin, which reveals his horrifying true form, this has been used to terrify Zombozo, fight the giant tick, and as a way for Ghostfreaks inner self to free itself. The original Ghostfreak was grated a second layer of skin to make him usable in sunlight(at the cost of eliminating many of his powers) it is also meant for extreme combat.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png" data-ref-id="1300-3551192" data-ratio="0.75433070866142" data-width="635" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 635px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.4%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png" data-ref-id="1300-3551192"><img alt="Wildmutt" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png 635w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png 320w"><noscript><img alt="Wildmutt" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png 635w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wildmutt</figcaption></figure><p><b>Wildmutt</b> is a Vulpimancer that has a body shape that appears to be a cross between a lion, a wolf and a gorilla.

Heatblast possess great strength and invulnerability.</p><p>Heatblast can undergo a process dubbed "meltdown" by Gwen in the episode where Ben turns into an even younger boy. During the fight in the underground cavern with Hex, the young Heatblast raises the temperature inside the cavern to such a degree that the water starts boiling and eventually vaporizes. This feat is also shown in the episode where Ben and family attends a wedding. In the fight with Camille's parents; they combine and devour heatblast by covering him up. However Heatblast used the meltdown skill by raising his body temperature to the point where the mud creatures eventually turned to stone, allowing Heatblast to break out from their stomache.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551199-9304558410-16_St.png" data-ref-id="1300-3551199" data-ratio="0.85643564356436" data-width="404" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 404px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:85.6%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551199-9304558410-16_St.png" data-ref-id="1300-3551199"><img alt="Stinkfly" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551199-9304558410-16_St.png" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551199-9304558410-16_St.png 404w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551199-9304558410-16_St.png 320w"><noscript><img alt="Stinkfly" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551199-9304558410-16_St.png" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551199-9304558410-16_St.png 404w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551199-9304558410-16_St.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Stinkfly</figcaption></figure><p>In any situation requiring flight, <b>Stinkfly</b> is Ben's alien of choice.

Cannonbolt can roll into a ball like an armadillo or pill bug to encase itself in this plating. There is enough space within the shell while rolled up to protect and transport people or objects. When in the form of a rolled-up ball, Cannonbolt can increase its rotational momentum and roll into enemies as an attack, as well as ricocheting himself off surfaces.</p><p>Cannonbolt demonstrated his extremely tough plates in Ben 10: Secret of The Omnitrix when he broke through three electric, metal doors in order to get to Azmuth, the creator of the Omnitrix.

By spinning in the same spot rapidly it can create a tornado like XLR8 and Terraspin .</p><p>Cannonbolt's armored shell is a defensive mechanism that is extremely resilient (but because of Ben's creativeness he has adapted this to attacks).</p><p>The shell is durable enough to survive a free fall from the upper limits of the Earth's atmosphere and including the heat of atmospheric re-entry, and still leave Cannonbolt and anything held inside the ball intact, though the landing still creates some pain due to the large crater left there.

His size also grants him incredible strength and he has also shown great durability, withstanding fire from enemies while barely even feeling them.</p><p>For his size Way Big is incredibly fast but it takes a bit of a build up. He was able to run around a trash monster bigger than he was and generated a cyclone-like effect that sucked up the monster and sent it hurdling into space( However Derrick J. Wyatt stated that was a power glitch ). Way Big can also fire powerful cosmic rays, these rays are powerful enough to disintegrate a small fleet of spaceships and could destroy a small planet in one shot</p><p>In addition, he is immensely strong and powerful even for his size. He can create shockwaves equivalent to earthquakes, beat Vilgax twice, and even outmatch Evil Way Big (a "member" of his species, hence the name) and send him flying all the way from Tokyo to outer space/the moon (in Cosmic Destruction), but it should be noted he use the potis altiare to fight Evil Way Big/Albedo.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551205-8498628197-Ditto.png" data-ref-id="1300-3551205" data-ratio="0.95578231292517" data-width="294" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 294px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:95.6%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551205-8498628197-Ditto.png" data-ref-id="1300-3551205"><img alt="Ditto" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" data-width="294" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551205-8498628197-Ditto.png" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551205-8498628197-Ditto.png 294w"><noscript><img alt="Ditto" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551205-8498628197-Ditto.png" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551205-8498628197-Ditto.png 294w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" data-width="294"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ditto</figcaption></figure><p><b>Ditto</b> is a small, humanoid alien with the ability to clone himself without limit.

In the episode, after some continued fight, Ben's Omnitrix is scratched(with no damage on it) by the Lobon thought to be the Yenadooshi. The Omnitrix was somehow stuck between Capture Mode and Active Mode, and as a result, the transformation is gradual instead of instantaneous (like a werewolf).</p><p>Blitzwolfer is very muscular, tall, has dog-like back legs, stands on his back legs, and has a face and muzzle that looks like a Mexican wolf's face and muzzle. He also has many animal-like tendencies. Blitzwolfer has enhanced strength, speed and agility; supposedly being able to lift approximately 500 lbs and run over 70 mph. In addition to Blitzwolfer's formidable claws, fangs, and muscles, he can emit an ultrasonic howl if the parts of his quadra-hinged muzzle is opened and a shout is let out. He can also do a jump attack by using his claws to slash the air.</p><p><b>Snare-oh's</b> appearance differs slightly from the other Thep Khufans. His eyes and the gaps between its bandages glow green instead of purple. Snare-oh also has black bracers and greaves, as well as a smaller mask and the Omnitrix symbol on his left shoulder. Snare-oh can speak, even though the other Khufan that attacked Ben seems to be mute. In originial series, Ben didn't know how to use Snare-oh's powers when he turned into this alien.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551219-6697463169-Benmu.PNG" data-ref-id="1300-3551219" data-ratio="0.68062827225131" data-width="382" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 382px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:68.1%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551219-6697463169-Benmu.PNG" data-ref-id="1300-3551219"><img alt="Snare-oh (formally known as Benmummy)" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551219-6697463169-Benmu.PNG" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551219-6697463169-Benmu.PNG 382w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551219-6697463169-Benmu.PNG 320w"><noscript><img alt="Snare-oh (formally known as Benmummy)" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551219-6697463169-Benmu.PNG" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551219-6697463169-Benmu.PNG 382w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551219-6697463169-Benmu.PNG 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Snare-oh (formally known as Benmummy)</figcaption></figure><p>Similar to those used on Egyptian mummies, Snare-oh is also covered in many bandages. This allows Thep Khufans to reshape their bodies at will, splitting themselves apart to dodge attacks and reforming to counter- attack. To compensate for its relatively weak form, these aliens can recover from basically any injury, including being torn into confetti by a large fan, almost instantly and with no visible repercussions. When Ben first uses the form, he had trouble figuring out how to control it; Ben quickly discovers how to stretch his bandages, but has not displayed knowledge of the advanced reshaping techniques yet. Snare-oh can also use his bandages as some sort of tentacles which allows him to grab his enemies and throw them with ease with out the use of his super strength. Snare-oh's bandages make him extremely light, allowing him to be thrown by beings with human strength or blown away by strong enough winds. Despite his build, however, Snare-oh is still incredibly strong. In addition to strength, Snare-oh also has a surprising amount of speed and agility, enough to scale walls and dodge attacks with relative ease. His composition also allows him to survive in a vacuum. This is probably due to the fact that his body is made of fibers that come from the shell-like head. The head is the only "true" part of the creature.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551229-0557252823-Benvi.png" data-ref-id="1300-3551229" data-ratio="1.885" data-width="200" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 200px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:188.5%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551229-0557252823-Benvi.png" data-ref-id="1300-3551229"><img alt="Frankenstrike( formally known as Benvictor)" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" data-width="200" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551229-0557252823-Benvi.png" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551229-0557252823-Benvi.png 200w"><noscript><img alt="Frankenstrike( formally known as Benvictor)" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551229-0557252823-Benvi.png" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551229-0557252823-Benvi.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" data-width="200"></noscript></a><figcaption>Frankenstrike( formally known as Benvictor)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Frankenstrike</strong> can generate "green" (unlike like the normal purple of the species) electricity and manipulate the resulting energy to attack enemies or adhere himself to metal through magnetism.

data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Exodus 10:21 is a character created to be part of the series Elementals. The Elementals was a dark superhero comic book with strong mature story lines. It was first published Comico Comics in 1984 and created by Bill Willingham, for which he was both writer and artist.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Exodus 10:21 is a member of the Rapture, a group of superheroes working for televangelist Reverend <a href="/jeremy-skagg/4005-54945/" data-ref-id="4005-54945">Skagg</a>. Advised by a disguised <a href="/shapeshifter/4005-27599/" data-ref-id="4005-27599">Shapeshifter</a> he made a plea to his viewers for volunteers with police or military backgrounds to come forward and join his holy crusade. Twelve hundred volunteers came forward, and Skagg tortured them to death, each in a unique and brutal manner; as Shapeshifter had expected, the violent deaths attracted the <a href="/shadowspear/4055-55681/" data-ref-id="4055-55681">Shadowspear</a>, a storm of magical energy previously assembled by Shapeshifter's former ally <a href="/saker/4005-27598/" data-ref-id="4005-27598">Saker</a>, and its energies resurrected six of the twelve hundred as undead superhumans, the <a href="/the-rapture/4060-55093/" data-ref-id="4060-55093">Rapture</a>, naming each individual for passages in the Bible. </p><p> In Exodus 10:21's case, her passage reads "Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt—darkness that can be felt.”" After initially establishing a reputation doing good deeds, the Rapture ambushed the <a href="/elementals/4060-41578/" data-ref-id="4060-41578">Elementals </a>away from public view, as Skagg viewed that hero team as abominations serving Satan. </p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Exodus 10:21 had the power to create a physical manifestation of darkness. She demonstrated the ability to shape this darkness into huge hands, shielding barriers, and entanglements. However, she proved vulnerable to bright lights and was dissipated by an intense brilliance generated by <a href="/morningstar/4005-4666/" data-ref-id="4005-4666">Morningstar's</a> flames.</p>]]></description><first_appeared_in_issue><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-48142/]]></api_detail_url><id>48142</id><name><![CDATA[The Book of Creation]]></name><issue_number>22</issue_number></first_appeared_in_issue><gender>2</gender><id>55095</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/395088-30146-exodus-10-21.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/395088-30146-exodus-10-21.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/395088-30146-exodus-10-21.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/395088-30146-exodus-10-21.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/395088-30146-exodus-10-21.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/395088-30146-exodus-10-21.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/395088-30146-exodus-10-21.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Exodus 10:21]]></name><origin><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/origin/4030-9/]]></api_detail_url><id>9</id><name><![CDATA[Other]]></name></origin><publisher><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/publisher/4010-336/]]></api_detail_url><id>336</id><name><![CDATA[Comico]]></name></publisher><real_name/><site_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/exodus-1021/4005-55095/]]></site_detail_url><resource_type><![CDATA[character]]></resource_type></character><concept><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/concept/4015-56241/]]></api_detail_url><count_of_isssue_appearances>10</count_of_isssue_appearances><date_added>2013-07-18 10:00:18</date_added><date_last_updated>2014-04-01 10:30:23</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Aspen's 10th Anniversary Initiative]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h4><em>***NOTE: This concept should only be attached to Aspen's #1 and relaunch issues.

Nazis, Catholics, werewolves, and Australian mercenaries is that all the way up to, and possibly through, this final volume, we don't know who's going to win. The streets of London are awash in blood, a zeppelin descends a la Hindenburg, and six of our favorite characters are locked in face-off fights. It's possible that no one will come away from this crescendo "alive." Of course, we're not sure who's alive or undead at this point.

Hellsing's Motto.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2> <b><u> History</u></b></h2>        Hellsing was written and illustrated by <a data-ref-id="4040-45909" href="/kouta-hirano/4040-45909/" slug="kouta-hirano">Kouta Hirnao</a> it was released in 1997 and published in Young Kings Outs and recently ended this year in September 08. It was taken and collected in a series of manga that span 9 issues.. It has also spanned into a prequel being made called Hellsing: The Dawn that follows <a data-ref-id="4005-44583" href="/alucard/4005-44583/" slug="alucard">Alucard</a> and <a data-ref-id="4005-44606" href="/walter-c-donez/4005-44606/" slug="walter-c-donez">Walter C Dornez</a>     in during the 2nd world war. Due to its growing popularity it soon became an Anime Series that was that followed its own plot. It spanned 13 episodes and was broadcast in October 2001 and finished in January 2002. An OVA was released after in January 2006 and follows the manga story line it is currently ongoing and has six episodes so far.release <br/> <br/><h2>BIO</h2><p>Great Britain, in the Hellsing Universe, despite strong appearances to the contrary, is still essentially ruled by a monarchy heavily supported by a group of twelve aristocrats, the Convention of Twelve, each commanding a section of the main power structure in the staunchly Protestant country. These seats are hereditary, and one of them is reserved for the heir of the <a data-ref-id="4005-62851" href="/abraham-van-helsing/4005-62851/" slug="abraham-van-helsing">Van Helsing</a> family, who have taken the name Hellsing. The Hellsing Family oversees matters concerning supernatural threats and their neutralization. Its founder, Abraham Van Helsing himself, and a group of adventurers, captured and subjugated the most powerful of all vampires, the ancient voivode of Wallachia, <a data-ref-id="4005-44583" href="/alucard/4005-44583/" slug="alucard">Dracula</a> himself. <br/></p> <p>This powerful undead was experimented upon, its powers enhanced to abominable levels, and used as a weapon to destroy Great Britain's supernatural enemies. It was renamed <a data-ref-id="4005-44583" href="/alucard/4005-44583/" slug="alucard">Alucard</a>, and bonded to the Van Helsing bloodline to obey as their servant. The first recorded usage of this living weapon came in WWII, when by orders of the then holder of the Hellsing title and manor, <a data-ref-id="4005-62850" href="/arthur-hellsing/4005-62850/" slug="arthur-hellsing">Sir Arthur Hellsing</a>, Alucard was deployed along with fellow Hellsing servant <a data-ref-id="4005-44606" href="/walter-c-donez/4005-44606/" slug="walter-c-donez">Walter C. Dornez</a>, to destroy the Nazi Order 666 camp and experiments, which dabbled in the creation of artificial vampires through different forms of surgery and serums. This mission would be successful, though with unforeseeable consequences for the Organization and London itself. This was mainly due to the strange survival of the three main Order 666 members, the Major, the Doctor and the Captain, who would move on to South America with great amounts of the stolen Nazi wealth and many followers, eventually founding the <a data-ref-id="4060-45562" href="/millennium/4060-45562/" slug="millennium">Millennium</a> Group.</p> <p>Alucard would be later sealed under Sir Arthur's orders, who believed he was "too strong a draught to be used more than the occasional medicine"; Walter would continue to serve the Hellsings as their butler and personal trashman. Upon Arthur's death, his brother, <a data-ref-id="4005-62854" href="/richard-hellsing/4005-62854/" slug="richard-hellsing">Richard</a>, hoped to be named heir to the title and manor, but Arthur had unexpectedly named his own young daughter, <a data-ref-id="4005-44614" href="/integral-fairbrook-wingates-hellsing/4005-44614/" slug="integral-fairbrook-wingates-hellsing">Integra</a>, as the successor. Enraged by this, Richard attempted to kill the girl, but, acting upon her father's orders upon emergency states, she snuck to the manor's dark cellars, and found the cell where the dessicated vampire still rested. Richard found her there and shot her, non-fatally. While he was moving in for the kill, the girl's blood powered up the vampire's corpse, and acting upon the commands to protect its master, it killed the men accompanying Richard, defended the young Integra, and allowed to execute her traitorous uncle.</p> <p>Eventually, Alucard returned to prominency upon the rise of artificial vampires on Great Britain; as the greatest anti-vampire agent, he was often used to deal with the threats. One night in 1998, Alucard sired a fledging, a former policewoman named <a data-ref-id="4005-45136" href="/seras-victoria/4005-45136/" slug="seras-victoria">Seras Victoria</a>, who had nearly died in the struggle against a vampire priest. The young Draculina was forced to incorporate into the organization and her status was reported as KIA. Alucard was forced to abide for his decision and guide her in the ways of vampirism. He was then drawn into a confrontation against the Hellsing Organization's Catholic opposite, the Vatican's own <a data-ref-id="4060-46183" href="/section-xiii-iscariot/4060-46183/" slug="section-xiii-iscariot">Section XIII</a>: Iscariot, and their own ace card: the Paladin <a data-ref-id="4005-44693" href="/father-alexander-anderson/4005-44693/" slug="father-alexander-anderson">Alexander Anderson</a>, upon attacking a target in Badrick, Ireland.<br/></p> <p>Shortly after, a strike team composed of two artificial vampires (<a data-ref-id="4005-45600" href="/jan-valentine/4005-45600/" slug="jan-valentine">Jan</a> and <a data-ref-id="4005-45593" href="/luke-valentine/4005-45593/" slug="luke-valentine">Luke Valentine</a>) and a large assembly or armored ghouls, soulless vampiric puppets, struck at the Organization's HQ during a Convention of Twelve meeting, and decimated the organization's ranks until only four active operatives survived: Walter, Integra, Alucard and Seras. Upon the destruction of the invading forces, the defenders heard from Jan Valentine's lips a single word, their sole lead on their attackers: Millennium. In seeking information, Iscariot, through means of its leader, Bishop <a data-ref-id="4005-47158" href="/enrico-maxwell/4005-47158/" slug="enrico-maxwell">Enrico Maxwell,</a> offered Hellsing a dossier containing information of the Millennium Group to pay the blood debt incurred in the Ireland incident, though Integra did not like Iscariot meddling in Great Britain and liked Maxwell even less because of his own chauvinist, arrogant and fanatical views. Because of the devastating attack against Hellsing's ranks, Dornez hired a huge force of mercenaries known as the Wild Geese to serve as their standing army, with Commander <a data-ref-id="4005-44756" href="/pip-bernadotte/4005-44756/" slug="pip-bernadotte">Pip Bernadotte</a> as direct leader under Integra's orders.<br/></p> <p>Hellsing then would move on against Millennium, seeking them in South America, starting on Rio de Janeiro. A Millennium operative, also an artificial vampire (<a data-ref-id="4005-50787" href="/tubalcain-alhambra/4005-50787/" slug="tubalcain-alhambra">Tubalcain Alhambra</a>) attacked them; he was promptly killed after a spectacular declaration of war against Millennium. While at a summit between the Convention, Hellsing and Iscariot, a Millennium envoy (<a data-ref-id="4005-48732" href="/schrodinger/4005-48732/" slug="schrodinger">Schrodinger</a>) reached past security and delivered a TV from the Major, who responded to the declaration of war and challenged all present to stop him. Not much later, another Millennium operative, a sharpshooter (Rip Van Winkle) moved in and captured a VTOL carrier near the English coast, the <i>Eagle</i>, surrendered by traitorous Englishmen, similarly vampirized.</p> <p><a data-ref-id="4005-46192" href="/rip-van-winkle/4005-46192/" slug="rip-van-winkle">Van Winkle</a> defended the ship against external attacks, but was ill-equipped to handle a kamikaze attack by Alucard, who reclaimed the warship at the cost of wrecking it. As Alucard could not cross the ocean without external means of locomotion, Millennium was poised for an attack on English soil. Thus, Hellsing lost its ace card, allowing Millennium to brutally level London with a barrage of missiles when the military and navy's communications were jammed and the Nazi zeppelins loomed over the city. Integra was forced to move through the destroyed city after leaving a defense commitee, and Walter left her to battle <a data-ref-id="4005-50786" href="/the-captain/4005-50786/" slug="the-captain">the Captain</a>; she would find Alexander Anderson and join his Iscariot batallion, as the armies of Christianity moved for another Crusade. Hellsing, the only local agency trained to deal with the threat, sealed itself and barricaded within the manor. Another Millennium operative (<a data-ref-id="4005-48733" href="/zorin-blitz/4005-48733/" slug="zorin-blitz">Zorin Blitz</a>) attacked the manor with a detachment of Millennium shocktroopers, but the zeppelin she commanded and the missiles it carried were destroyed by heavy  gunfire by Seras' Harkonnen II Field Dominance Weapons System, leaving Zorin with no option but to command ground invasion of the manor, aided by her illusory powers. There, because of her sadism and hubris, she committed several critical mistakes, including leaving Seras alive after a brutal beating, giving her the chance to finally accept her heritage (she had previously refused to drink blood) and drain the recently deceased Captain Bernadotte, absorbing his soul and becoming a full vampire.</p> <p>With regenerated strength, Seras all but shredded Zorin's men, saving the few Geese still standing, and then moved in to execute Blitz. She then used her new powers to manifest a shadow-matter wing and flew to downtown London to defend Integra from the Iscariot priests she had been forced to travel with for protection, who were ready to act upon Maxwell's orders and apprehend her, at the immense fury of Paladin Anderson, who objected such a measure, knowing full well Maxwell intended to settle a silly vendetta at the cost of the lives of countless Englishmen. Alucard, meanwhile, had manifested shadow-matter sails for the <i>Eagle</i>, enveloped the warship in a bank of mist and crashed right into the battle of the Christian armies against Millennium forces. Alucard then manifested the entirety of all the familiars he had ever absorbed, adding countless warriors to the fight for England; these were considered the Army of Hellsing, along with Integra and Seras. Alucard would then confront in sucession a divinely empowered form of Anderson and a vampirized Walter; the main result of these encointers was the virtual destruction of Iscariot. Meanwhile, Seras and Integra fought the last of the Major's forces and ultimately destroyed the Millennium threat by killing the remaining vampire Nazis and the Captain. <br/></p> <p>On his side, Alucard defeated Walter and started drinking the blood from all of London. This was "poisoned" with Schrodinger's blood, making him fade out of existence due to the nature of the powers of the catboy. The last to die were Walter and the Doctor, leaving the Hellsing Organization down to a few Geese guarding the ruins of the manor, Seras and Integra. Thirty years later, Integra would remark she believed the institution would die with her, shortly before Alucard's return.<br/></p>Current Roster  <ul class="plain-list"> <li>Sir Integral Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing (Possible last leader)</li> <li>Alucard (Returned after thirty years after the Battle of London, mostly depowered)<br/></li> <li>Seras Victoria (Standing vampire of the Hellsing Organization)<br/></li> <li>Pip Bernadotte and The Wild Geese (Deceased during Zorin Blitz's attack against Hellsing Manor and blood and soul offered to Seras; all but three operatives KIA)</li></ul>]]></description><first_appeared_in_issue><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-251482/]]></api_detail_url><id>251482</id><name><![CDATA[Vol. 1]]></name><issue_number>1</issue_number></first_appeared_in_issue><id>44615</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/132759-196613-hellsing.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/132759-196613-hellsing.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/132759-196613-hellsing.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/132759-196613-hellsing.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/132759-196613-hellsing.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/132759-196613-hellsing.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/132759-196613-hellsing.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Hellsing]]></name><publisher><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/publisher/4010-2814/]]></api_detail_url><id>2814</id><name><![CDATA[Shōnen Gahōsha]]></name></publisher><site_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/hellsing/4060-44615/]]></site_detail_url><resource_type><![CDATA[team]]></resource_type></team><team><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-44519/]]></api_detail_url><count_of_isssue_appearances>0</count_of_isssue_appearances><count_of_team_members>5</count_of_team_members><date_added>2008-06-06 11:27:43</date_added><date_last_updated>2013-02-01 16:36:14</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Team 10 is a strong team of Asuma, Choji, Ino, and Shikamaru and Kakashi.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Teamwork</h2><p>Team 10 is known used for quickly taking out the opponent. Either <a data-ref-id="4005-44247" href="/shikamaru-nara/4005-44247/" slug="shikamaru-nara">Shikamaru</a> or Ino disables the opponent as <a data-ref-id="4005-44249" href="/choji-akimichi/4005-44249/" slug="choji-akimichi">Choji</a> and <a data-ref-id="4005-44514" href="/asuma-sarutobi/4005-44514/" slug="asuma-sarutobi">Asuma</a> finish off the opponent. They can also be used as disabling a person in an espionage mission. Their mission's were supposedly very successful, as Asuma recommended them for the Chunin Exam. As a job well done and a successful mission they go to a restaurant and eat for celebration of their victory, they are satisfied and worn out, but they are still happy.</p><h2>Their Bond</h2><p>Team 10 mostly got along with each other, especially Shikamaru and Choji, they were friends before going to the academy and they are still friends after. Ino had some problems with the team because she was kind of mean and a snob, Asuma was a great leader, mostly when the squad is in trouble he just pops out and saves their lives against higher ninja. When they were <a data-ref-id="4005-44242" href="/sakura-haruno/4005-44242/" slug="sakura-haruno">Sakura</a>, <a data-ref-id="4005-44238" href="/naruto-uzumaki/4005-44238/" slug="naruto-uzumaki">Naruto</a>, Shikamaru were on the mission to get <a data-ref-id="4005-44241" href="/sasuke-uchiha/4005-44241/" slug="sasuke-uchiha">Sasuke</a> from reaching <a data-ref-id="4005-44258" href="/gaara/4005-44258/" slug="gaara">Gaara</a>, Shikamaru made a tactic that leaves one member behind, himself, almost killed and out of chalkra Asuma saves his life from being dead by sound ninja. Asuma gives advice to the team whether it hurts or not, just like when Asuma told Choji to stop eating and do some training, Shikamaru was there to help Choji. Team 10 has a great bond together.</p><h2>Missions</h2><p>They solve their missions by hiding and figuring out a plan by Shikamru with his power of 200 I.Q. Shikamaru catches them in a shadow clone justu and pauses them for a kill. Another plan is Shikamaru uses his shadow clone jutsu and pauses them, and then Choji uses his size manipulation jutsu and knock them over like bowling pins with great force. If they are going against a very strong team they or trying to be sneaky or trying to get pass something No is the right girl for the job, she can use her mind translation jutsu and get into other people's body with her mind. Or they all can use their sneaky tactics and capture the enemy instead of killing them. They solve their missions sneaky, and quick, and powerful.</p>]]></description><first_appeared_in_issue><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-130576/]]></api_detail_url><id>130576</id><name><![CDATA[The Challengers]]></name><issue_number>5</issue_number></first_appeared_in_issue><id>44519</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/1178143-narutimate_accel_3_team_10_by_adel123456789.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/1178143-narutimate_accel_3_team_10_by_adel123456789.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/1178143-narutimate_accel_3_team_10_by_adel123456789.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/1178143-narutimate_accel_3_team_10_by_adel123456789.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/1178143-narutimate_accel_3_team_10_by_adel123456789.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/1178143-narutimate_accel_3_team_10_by_adel123456789.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/1178143-narutimate_accel_3_team_10_by_adel123456789.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Team 10]]></name><publisher><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/publisher/4010-1867/]]></api_detail_url><id>1867</id><name><![CDATA[Shueisha]]></name></publisher><site_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/team-10/4060-44519/]]></site_detail_url><resource_type><![CDATA[team]]></resource_type></team><team><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-40397/]]></api_detail_url><count_of_isssue_appearances>0</count_of_isssue_appearances><count_of_team_members>39</count_of_team_members><date_added>2008-06-06 11:27:47</date_added><date_last_updated>2013-03-03 06:09:02</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Top 10 is a super-group under Alan Moore's America's Best Comics imprint.

Bringing these powered beings together solved some problems but created others, especially after the inevitable partnerships led to a surge in their numbers in the 1960's. By the 1980's, Neopolis had turned into a pressure cooker- under-financed and overpopulated- that normal policing methods could never hope to contain. In 1985 the city accepted jurisdiction by a police force covering many alternate earths, headquartered on the world known as Grand Central. Neopolis's outpost of this network is Precinct Ten (more commonly known as Top 10), it recruits its members from the Neopolis population. Working much like earths other precincts with one major exaction: the officers of Top 10 have the abilities needed to deal with Neopolis's exotic

Many escaped to the west. But after Mao's death, his party soon realized that they did not have any superpowered protectors of their own to counter those of other countries.</p><p>They soon searched for any metahumans in China. Superheroes were dubbed 'super-functionaries' and they formed the Great Ten from China's greatest powers, although they all weren't necessarily heroes. The first four members of the team were created when the Chinese government captured a <a data-ref-id="4060-42477" href="/durlan/4060-42477/">Durlan</a> space craft.

At that time, one of the gang's fences was Albert Talbot. Talbot had plans to set up a girlfriend of his as a costumed villain, but the money he had coming in from the 100 convinced him to stay with them. In time he rose to the top of the organization, becoming its leader.</p><p>Then the 100 had Detective Sergeant Phillip Forrest killed - a shock which caused his daughter <a data-ref-id="4005-7092" href="/rose/4005-7092/" slug="rose">             Rose</a> to develop a split personality and she became the character known as Rose and <a data-ref-id="4005-7099" href="/thorn/4005-7099/" slug="thorn">            Thorn</a>. Ironically, it was in Talbot's old house that the Forrest's lived and one day in the adjoining shop, Rose found the costume and equipment she needed to fight the 100 as the Thorn. Talbot's face was subsequently scarred in a fire, and he was captured by Thorn and sent to prison.</p><p>By this time the 100 had entered into high tech crime. The organization had split itself into 10 divisions, each self perpetuating - so that if one member was lost, another was enlisted. These divisions were known as; the Amazons, the Dynamiters, the Hunters, the Mind-Benders, the Space Raiders, the Stealers, the Agents, the Sea Wolves, the Mobsters and the Athletes.</p><p>Driven underground by the Thorn and Superman, the 100 were quiet for some considerable time. Their re - emergence brought about the creation of another crime fighter - <a data-ref-id="4005-10994" href="/black-lightning/4005-10994/" slug="black-lightning">           Black Lightning</a>. At this time, <a data-ref-id="4005-34795" href="/whale/4005-34795/" slug="whale">          Tobias Whale</a> was the head of the group, and when he captured Whale, Black Lightning thought he had brought an end to the 100. However, the group once again survived and underwent another transformation.</p><p>This time, the Director of the 1,000 as it was now known, was US senator Ballard, whose grand scheme was to become President of the USA. At the time, this plot involved the assassination of President <a data-ref-id="4005-30220" href="/ronald-reagan/4005-30220/" slug="ronald-reagan">         Reagan</a> and Vice-President <a data-ref-id="4005-9957" href="/george-bush-sr/4005-9957/" slug="george-bush-sr">        Bush</a>, which would be carried out by someone known as the <a data-ref-id="4005-28845" href="/chiller/4005-28845/" slug="chiller">       Chiller</a>. Once he had achieved his objective, the Chiller - who was a shape shifter - would take Reagan's place, with only Bush's body being found. He would then appoint Ballard as his new VP, and a short time later would resign due to ailing health, leaving Ballard to run the country and free to insert members of the 1000 in places of authority throughout the US. This plan was thwarted by <a data-ref-id="4005-1786" href="/booster-gold/4005-1786/" slug="booster-gold">      Booster Gold</a> and three members of the <a data-ref-id="4060-19241" href="/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/" slug="legion-of-super-heroes">     Legion of Super-Heroes</a>. Since that time, the 1000 have clashed with Booster and the Thorn.</p>]]></description><first_appeared_in_issue><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-122958/]]></api_detail_url><id>122958</id><name><![CDATA[Death

The Guardians of the Galaxy staged a rebellion on Earth aided by <a href="/captain-america/4005-1442/" data-ref-id="4005-1442">Captain America</a> and the <a href="/thing/4005-2114/" data-ref-id="4005-2114">Thing</a> who traveled from the 20th Century to the 31st Century. Several months later, the Guardians traveled to the 20th Century to gain information on a failed Badoon invasion that occurred in that time period.</p><p>While on this mission, the Guardians met 20th Century heroes, the <a href="/defenders/4060-26333/" data-ref-id="4060-26333">Defenders</a>, and team-up to fight a mutated eel. The Defenders returned with the Guardians to the 31st Century to fight the Badoon empire. The Guardians are later joined by <a href="/starhawk/4005-2168/" data-ref-id="4005-2168">Starhawk</a>. Both teams worked together to eventually defeat the Badoon's oppressive regime.</p><p>The Defenders returned to their own time period while the Guardians and other surviving rebels of the war rebuilt their civilization. The Guardians eventually left Earth as space explorers and adventurers and recruited <a href="/nikki/4005-13897/" data-ref-id="4005-13897">Nikki</a> along the way. During these adventures, the Guardians learned that the Silver Surfer prevented the Badoon invasion of Earth in the 20th Century. They also learned about Starhawk's other half, <a href="/aleta/4005-15994/" data-ref-id="4005-15994">Aleta</a>.</p><p>The Guardians aided by <a href="/thor/4005-2268/" data-ref-id="4005-2268">Thor</a> from the 20th Century encountered one of their greatest foes, <a href="/korvac/4005-14467/" data-ref-id="4005-14467">Korvac</a>, which led to a significant story arc known as the <a href="/korvac-saga/4045-55755/" data-ref-id="4045-55755">Korvac Saga</a>. The Guardians had followed Korvac to the 20th Century and fought side by side with that era's mightiest heroes, the <a href="/avengers/4060-3806/" data-ref-id="4060-3806">Avengers</a>, against Korvac. The Guardians were all granted honorary Avengers membership after this event.</p><p>After staying in the 20th Century for some time, the Guardians continued to have various adventures with other heroes such as the <a href="/thing/4005-2114/" data-ref-id="4005-2114">Thing</a> and <a href="/spider-man/4005-1443/" data-ref-id="4005-1443">Spider-Man</a>. Vance Astro even met his younger self (actually parallel counterpart) and inadvertently unleashed young Vance's own latent psychic abilities.</p><p>This results in young Vance Astrovik in walking a path different from Vance Astro. Young Vance grows up to be <a href="/justice/4005-4811/" data-ref-id="4005-4811">Justice</a> of the <a href="/new-warriors/4060-11896/" data-ref-id="4060-11896">New Warriors</a> and later the Avengers. The Guardians eventually returned to their own time period and decide to embark on a quest to recover Captain America's lost <a href="/captain-americas-shield/4055-50737/" data-ref-id="4055-50737">shield</a>. This <a href="/quest-for-the-shield/4045-55833/" data-ref-id="4045-55833">quest for the shield</a> sets the stage for significant events in the lives of the Guardians. After finding Captain America's shield, Vance Astro was able to safely remove his life-preserving suit and change into a different uniform. Vance changed his name as well to Major Victory.</p><p>The group also acquired a few more members such as <a href="/firelord/4005-7108/" data-ref-id="4005-7108">Firelord</a>, <a href="/replica/4005-26121/" data-ref-id="4005-26121">Replica</a>, <a href="/hollywood/4005-25860/" data-ref-id="4005-25860">Hollywood</a> (Earth-691 Wonder Man), <a href="/talon/4005-15993/" data-ref-id="4005-15993">Talon</a> and <a href="/rita-demara/4005-1501/" data-ref-id="4005-1501">Yellowjacket</a> (Rita DeMara from Earth-616). Martinex took a leave of absence from the group to form the <a href="/galactic-guardians/4060-56284/" data-ref-id="4060-56284">Galactic Guardians</a> in an effort to expand the Guardians operations. He recruited Firelord, Replica, Mainframe (Earth-691 <a href="/vision/4005-1504/" data-ref-id="4005-1504">Vision</a>), <a href="/spirit-of-vengeance/4005-26120/" data-ref-id="4005-26120">Spirit of Vengeance</a>, Hollywood and <a href="/phoenix-ix/4005-26122/" data-ref-id="4005-26122">Phoenix IX</a>.</p><p>The Galactic Guardians completed several missions before Martinex eventually returned to the Guardians of the Galaxy. By the end of this series, Starhawk, Firelord, Replica, Talon and Yellowjacket had left the group for their own reasons and the remaining Guardians embarked on another mission in the past.</p><p>The series ended with the group composed of Charlie-27, Nikki, Major Victory, Martinex, Aleta, Yondu and Hollywood. The Guardians make their most recent appearance with this lineup in New Warriors vol 1 #68. No sign of the Guardians has been seen since until Major Victory and Starhawk suddenly appears in the second volume of the Guardians of the Galaxy series. No indication as to the whereabouts of the other Guardians.</p><h3>Earth-616 Guardians of the Galaxy</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/761830-guardians_line_up_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-761830" data-ratio="0.68671193016489" data-width="1031" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1031px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:68.7%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/761830-guardians_line_up_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-761830"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28028/761830-guardians_line_up_1.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/761830-guardians_line_up_1.jpg 1031w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/28028/761830-guardians_line_up_1.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28028/761830-guardians_line_up_1.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></a></figure><p>The Guardians of the Galaxy of the mainstream Marvel reality has recently been formed after the events of the <a href="/annihilation-conquest/4045-44982/" data-ref-id="4045-44982">Annihilation Conquest</a>.

But before the other Guardians could use the time machine, they slipped through time once again.</p><h3>Return of the Magus</h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-1109414" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/1109414-magus_1.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.3023255813953" data-width="1032" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1032px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:130.2%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/1109414-magus_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1109414"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px" data-width="491" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/1109414-magus_1.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/1109414-magus_1.jpg 1032w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/31666/1109414-magus_1.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31666/1109414-magus_1.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/1109414-magus_1.jpg 491w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/1109414-magus_1.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/1109414-magus_1.jpg 1032w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/31666/1109414-magus_1.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31666/1109414-magus_1.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/1109414-magus_1.jpg 491w" sizes="(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px" data-width="491"></noscript></a></figure><p>The team fell through several alternate futures before arriving at one ruled by the <a href="/magus/4005-14619/" data-ref-id="4005-14619">Magus</a> and the <a href="/the-church-of-truth/4060-54776/" data-ref-id="4060-54776">Universal Church of Truth</a>. While being attacked by the followers of the Church, they were rescued by an unlikely ally: <a href="/kang/4005-2264/" data-ref-id="4005-2264">Kang the Conqueror</a>. He took them to limbo, where he had an army of Starhawk's from destroyed realities assisting him. He explained that Adam Warlock would become the Magus and all possible futures were becoming Magus futures. He gave Starlord a <a href="/cosmic-cube/4055-40949/" data-ref-id="4055-40949">Cosmic Cube</a> and sent them back to their own time, moments before Adam's transformation.</p><p>They arrive at the right time, but it is too late. In order to stop the expansion of the Fault, Adam had overlapped time with an unused future, the one in which he became the Magus. Once transformed, all the Guardians engaged him, to which the Magus seemed to have no problem in handling all of them. Starlord was able to turn Magus back into Adam Warlock, but only briefly. At Adam's request, the only was to stop the Magus was to kill him, which Starlord regrettably did.</p><p>The battle was costly and Adam was not the only member of the team to be lost. In battle with the Magus, several other members lost their lives fighting him, including Mantis, Cosmo, Major Victory, Gamora, and Phyla. They returned to Knowhere, having paid a high price for their victory. Magus, however, survived the battle. He faked his own death at the hands of Starlord to by time for his plan to create the Fault. He also faked the deaths of Mantis, Cosmo, Major Victory, Gamora, and Phyla. While trying to escape, Phyla unwittingly opens a cocoon containing <a href="/thanos/4005-7607/" data-ref-id="4005-7607">Thanos</a>, to take back his rightful place as the Avatar of Death.
