He was part of the Cult of the Hammer and with the power of Thor, helped to lead his people to freedom.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>The story</h2><p>In the year 2587 Earth will be very different. The city you now know as <a data-ref-id="4020-41183" href="/new-york-city/4020-41183/" slug="new-york-city">           New York</a> will be destroyed. New will rise above the old. The Corporation is the leader of the land and enslaves it's victims. There are no more costumed heroes only stories of what there was and of the fate of some lucky guy to become a Thor and be worthy. One day a rebel clan found the hammer of <a data-ref-id="4005-2268" href="/thor/4005-2268/" slug="thor">          Thor</a> and have planned to find one worthy of it's power. They believe the one who can lift it will be the one who will set them free.</p> <h3>New Hero </h3>A man named Dargo Ktor was apart of the rebel clan. His faith was not nearly as strong as others. He always predicted who ever tried to lift Thor's hammer would fail. ALl the stories about Thor he thought were fairy tales. Later, the Corporation hired <a data-ref-id="4005-4324" href="/loki/4005-4324/" slug="loki">         Loki</a> to destroy the rebels. Loki was happy to take this task and accepted it. So Loki and <a data-ref-id="4005-54458" href="/tyrus/4005-54458/" slug="tyrus">        Tyrus</a> leader of rock trolls found the rebel's hideout and attacked them. They killed all in their path and had no mercy. That's when Dargo reached for a weapon to save his fellow people. His hands guided him to the hammer of Thor. He lifted the hammer and great things occurred. Thor's power flowed through jis body and got the power of the thunder god. Dargo easily pushed back the enemies. But, he was so confused he had to go and clear his head. His peoples fate had risen and they began to protest against the Corporation. They felt save thanks to the new god of thunder. Dargo decided he would not let his people face the forces of evil alone and joined them. Dargo and his people were then attacked. He fought them as well as he could. Tyrus was there and had fought the real Thor before and found out he was an impostor. He found this out because the hammer of Thor did not want to go through with Dargo's commands. Dargo then defeated Tyrus and Loki killed the chairman of the Corporation. Now the Corporation was gone and defeated. So Dargo opened a portal with the hammer and throw the hammer in it. He did this so the hammer could return to it's rightful owner or give someone else a chance to prove themself worthy.           The hammer has returned<p>Later in the year of 2591 Dargo has somehow gained the hammer again. He then resumed being the mighty god of thunder. That's when Dargo was tricked by a man named <a data-ref-id="4005-9479" href="/zarrko/4005-9479/" slug="zarrko">       Zarrko</a>. Zarrko tricked him into going back in time to battle the present Thor named <a data-ref-id="4005-7611" href="/thunderstrike/4005-7611/" slug="thunderstrike">      Thunderstrike</a>. Zarrko said that Thunderstrike would destroy Dargo's timeline. In which will result in the death of his wife. Dargo the attacked Thunderstrike while he was already in a fight with <a data-ref-id="4005-25714" href="/stellaris/4005-25714/" slug="stellaris">     Stellaris</a>. The two of them were very surprised that they were evenly matched. That's when Zarrko revealed that he was going to use the two Thor hammers to power his time traveling machine. So he could become the master of all time. During that time the two Thor's were still fighting. Then Beta Ray Bill was alerted. He went to earth and stopped their fighting. He told them they were Hammer brothers and they were both worthy. He said they should join forces to battle evil together. So they all went to Zarrko's ship to stop him. They also decided to call them self the <a data-ref-id="4060-40428" href="/thor-corps/4060-40428/" slug="thor-corps">    Thor Corps</a>. Zarrko put them to the test by taking all of the Thor enemies from all different timelines and made them defeat all of these villains. In the end Zarrko made the biggest mistake by pulling Loki out of the time stream. Zarrko tried to control Loki but Loki would not have that happened. Loki was not going to be controlled by anyone so he attacked Zarrko and defeated him. Now Zarrko's ship was about to explode after Loki destroyed everything. So they came up with a plan. So <a data-ref-id="4005-6139" href="/beta-ray-bill/4005-6139/" slug="beta-ray-bill">   Beta Ray Bill</a> send each of them to there own timeline. So they all returned to their home where they will remain happy and fight the forces of evil.</p> <h3>Reunited once more </h3>Later in the year 2593 they reunite again. Dargo is forced to join back up with the Thor Corps by <a data-ref-id="4005-15991" href="/demonstaff/4005-15991/" slug="demonstaff">  Demonstaff</a>. Demonstaff is Dargo's worst enemy and they both hate each other a great amount. Demonstaff has Dargo's wife Salla and unless they return Demonstaff's wife Elene then Salla will die and he will destroy the reality. It turns out later they do find Demonstaffs wife but, she does not want him. This makes Demonstaff realize what he has done was wrong. So they return to their homes. It can be guessed Dargo is at home fighting villains with the power of Thor. <br/><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities<br/></h2><p>Dargo has all of the powers of Thor. This means he has superhuman strength, endurance, and high resistance to injury. Also he has the hammer of Thor which gives him all the mystical powers of Thor.</p>]]></description><first_appeared_in_issue><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-114773/]]></api_detail_url><id>114773</id><name><![CDATA["When Titans Plug!"]]></name><issue_number>3</issue_number></first_appeared_in_issue><gender>1</gender><id>15990</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/5529547-thor.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/5529547-thor.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/5529547-thor.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/5529547-thor.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/5529547-thor.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/5529547-thor.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/5529547-thor.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Dargo Ktor]]></name><origin><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/origin/4030-4/]]></api_detail_url><id>4</id><name><![CDATA[Human]]></name></origin><publisher><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/publisher/4010-31/]]></api_detail_url><id>31</id><name><![CDATA[Marvel]]></name></publisher><real_name><![CDATA[Dargo Ktor]]></real_name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dargo-ktor/4005-15990/]]></site_detail_url><resource_type><![CDATA[character]]></resource_type></character><character><aliases><![CDATA[Arthur Pendragon

In order to end the suffering, Proteus willed himself out of existence, taking Piecemeal with him.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p> </p><h2>Origin</h2><p>Piecemeal (Gilbert Benson) was a child, a mutant with the ability to track and absorb energy fields. Unbeknownst to him, his mutant powers would eventually be the reason why his mother turned against him. His mutant gifts would also have him merge with one of the most feared mutants to ever be in existence, <a href="/proteus/4005-2165/" data-ref-id="4005-2165"> Proteus</a>.</p><p>Two terrorists by the name of <a href="/gideon/4005-2162/" data-ref-id="4005-2162"> Gideon</a> (an immortal mutant member of the <a href="/externals/4060-13340/" data-ref-id="4060-13340">Externals</a>) and <a href="/toad/4005-1470/" data-ref-id="4005-1470"> Toad</a> (a long time <a href="/x-men/4060-3173/" data-ref-id="4060-3173"> X-Men</a> villain) oddly began to work together and became the self-styled “Kings of Pain.” During this unlikely partnership the two were informed that the energies of <a href="/moira-mactaggert/4005-8304/" data-ref-id="4005-8304">Moira MacTaggert's </a>son were still in existence, and could potentially be utilized as a weapon. Ultimately, their goal was to access and capture Proteus' energy patterns through-out the world, then use them to create super-powered minions that would work for them. All they needed was someone to do the work for them. This was when they met <a href="/harness/4005-2154/" data-ref-id="4005-2154">Harness</a>.</p><p>The "Kings," were able to lock down and get <a href="/genetech/4060-60044/" data-ref-id="4060-60044">GeneTech</a> and <a href="/aim/4060-13497/" data-ref-id="4060-13497">A.I.M</a>. These two groups would provide the hardware and man-power to get the job done. The way they decided to gather and hold the energy was by using a living person as the sponge and containment unit. Unfortunately for him, this living person was Piecemeal. This plan was nailed down due to an unlikely individual, his mother, Erika Benson. Erika was an operative of A.I.M., and willingly took up the job, knowing full well the danger her son would be placed in. She was given a battle suit, and a team, the <a href="/alliance-of-evil/4060-41656/" data-ref-id="4060-41656">Alliance of Evil</a>. They all set out (Piecemeal in tow) visiting each of the various places of Proteus' energy spikes. These locations were discovered by both mother and son (Harness' suit being able to follow the energy trail as well). Once they reached the Harness cruelly exploited her son and forced him to absorb or "eat," the aforementioned energies. He then stored them in his small body. This was a painful process which soon left Gilbert misshapen and bloated, and in a constant state of agony. It’s never revealed why Gilbert's mother was willing to put her son through such pain. (As the reader, you're never aware that the individual in the Harness armor is his mother until the end of the arc. Harness treated Gilbert so cruelly and with such disregard to his life, it’s just assumed that the individual in the armor was some evil menace that didn't care if the boy lived or died.)</p><p>They went to multiple locations to gather enough energy to "resurrect," Proteus. As he absorbed more and more energy, Piecemeal grew tremendously in size, upwards of 700 lbs, until the boy could no longer contain the tremendous force. It became a struggle simply to live.</p><p>These attempts to restore Proteus did not go unnoticed, however. A combination of teams (including the <a href="/new-mutants/4060-15971/" data-ref-id="4060-15971">New Mutants</a>, <a href="/new-warriors/4060-11896/" data-ref-id="4060-11896">New Warriors</a> and an oddly put together team of X-Men led by Moira) worked together to try and save Piecemeal therefore preventing the younger MacTaggert from resurfacing. They were able to pin down the next (and final) pocket of energy. It was in Edinburgh, Scotland where Proteus was finally defeated long ago by an earlier incarnation of the X-Men. The combined groups were able to make short work of Harness and her crew, but were too late to help Piecemeal stop absorbing the final amount of energy. They failed in trying to help release the energies from the young mutant. Unbeknownst to our heroes the Proteus energies reformed and were far too great in strength to be held in the dying boy's body. Seconds later, the Piecemeal's body exploded. When this occurred the two individuals combined to create one unstoppable entity with both boys' powers.</p><p>Proteus/Piecemeal was different from the original Proteus form, in that he was not angry or even evil.

She became seduced by a criminal named Marc LeGrande, who needed her to assist him in stealing an Egyptian artifact with an ancient herb inside it. After the crime was committed, Legrande decided that Isley knew too much to be allowed to live, so he poisoned her with the herb inside the artifact.</p><p>Fortunately for Isley, she survived and became immune to all manner of toxins and diseases. She realized that she was completely unaffected by certain plant-based hypnotic toxins that she could use to control others. Calling herself Poison Ivy, she began wearing a revealing green plant-like costume and turned to a life of crime, combining her natural allure with hypnotic plant toxins in order to manipulate people (particularly men) into doing her bidding.

Pamela Isley was now the beautiful daughter of wealthy parents from Seattle, but she was emotionally quite distant from them. Intellectually brilliant but shy and withdrawn, she immersed herself in advanced botanical biochemistry in college, proving to be a exemplary student with an unusual affinity for the world of plants. Unfortunately, Isley became seduced by her college professor, Dr. Jason Woodrue (who later became the villainous <a href="../../floronic-man/29-24969/" rel="nofollow">Floronic Man</a>). As part of a twisted experiment, Woodrue injected Isley with a deadly plant-based poison, which caused her physiology to dramatically transform.</p><p>Isley nearly died twice from the poisoning, and it also resulted in her never being able to bear children. A further side effect of the poisoning was that it drove her insane to the point where she believed she was the 'mother nature' of the plant world, and all plants were her 'children.' Woodrue abandoned Isley and fled from the authorities while she was hospitalized. After Isley was released from the hospital, she developed pronounced mood swings due to what the professor had done to her. She tried to resume her college career and even found a new boyfriend, but her mental state deteriorated further when her boyfriend died in a car accident after suffering a mysterious fungal overgrowth (the first manifestation of her plant-based powers). Deciding she needed a fresh start elsewhere, Isley dropped out of college and moved to Gotham City. But at that point, Isley's psychotic mentality finally overcame her. She took up the identity of Poison Ivy and adopted a revealing green one-piece costume much like the pre-Crisis version of the character. Her first criminal act was to hold the city hostage with deadly plant spores of her own creation until the city's leadership gave her a massive sum of money. Unfortunately for Ivy, this was the same year that Batman began operating in Gotham. He thwarted Ivy's scheme and defeated her, after which she was imprisoned in <a href="../../arkham-asylum/34-31682/" rel="nofollow">Arkham Asylum</a>. The encounter sparked Ivy's ongoing obsession with Batman, because he was the one man she could not easily gain control over.</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5599/202439-115958-poison-ivy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-202439" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.1227272727273" data-width="220" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 220px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:112.3%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5599/202439-115958-poison-ivy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-202439"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" data-width="220" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5599/202439-115958-poison-ivy.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5599/202439-115958-poison-ivy.jpg 220w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5599/202439-115958-poison-ivy.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5599/202439-115958-poison-ivy.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" data-width="220"></noscript></a></figure><p>The original Poison Ivy was created by writer <a href="../../robert-kanigher/26-43530/" rel="nofollow">Robert Kanigher</a> and artist <a href="../../sheldon-moldoff/26-19108/" rel="nofollow">Sheldon Moldoff</a> in 1966. Because the feminist movement was in full swing, DC decided that Batman needed another prominent female adversary, especially since his first villainess, <a href="../../catwoman/29-1698/" rel="nofollow">Catwoman</a>, was becoming more of a sympathetic character. The new villainess was given a plant-based theme, partially inspired by the titular character of the short story <i>Rappacini's Daughter</i>, written by Nathaniel Hawthorne in 1844. Like Hawthorne's literary character, Poison Ivy was envisioned as a beautiful temptress obsessed with dangerous plants, being immune to their toxic effects and employing them to both seduce and poison others.</p><p>Ivy's creators modeled her after the famous fetish model <a href="../../bettie-page/29-10633/" rel="nofollow">Bettie Page</a>, and she was given Page's trademark haircut and Southern drawl (later dropped after Ivy's origin revealed she was from Seattle). Ivy's original costume was essentially a strapless green bathing suit covered with leaves. Her costume has become more revealing over the decades as Ivy grew more plant-like in nature and appearance with each successive incarnation. Ivy's plant theme was also expanded upon, to the point where she developed into the ultimate Eco-terrorist, pathologically devoted to protecting the natural world at any cost. Writer <a href="../../j-t-krul/26-44461/" rel="nofollow">J. T. Krul</a>, who helped further define Poison Ivy's personality, summed up her character with the following quote:</p><p><i>The thing I love most about Poison Ivy is her walking that line between bastion of Mother Nature and psycho Eco-terrorist. She sees herself as the hand of Mother Nature. If Mother Nature were "God," then Ivy would be her "Jesus." She defends the defenseless nature of the world and truly believes in her cause. Maiming, mauling, and mutilating are extreme measures, but it's nothing compared to what humanity's done to the world of nature.</i> <i>Ivy always sees the greater good as she punishes those who deserve it.</i></p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3>Silver/Bronze Age</h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-73769" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4/73769-9219-70726-1-batman-shadow-of-th.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.53" data-width="400" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 400px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:153.0%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4/73769-9219-70726-1-batman-shadow-of-th.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-73769"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4/73769-9219-70726-1-batman-shadow-of-th.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4/73769-9219-70726-1-batman-shadow-of-th.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4/73769-9219-70726-1-batman-shadow-of-th.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4/73769-9219-70726-1-batman-shadow-of-th.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4/73769-9219-70726-1-batman-shadow-of-th.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4/73769-9219-70726-1-batman-shadow-of-th.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a></figure><p>Poison Ivy burst onto the comic book scene in <a href="../../batman-beware-of-poison-ivy-the-perfect-crime-slightly-imperfect/37-8577/" rel="nofollow">Batman #181</a> and quickly established herself as Batman's most dangerous new villainess.

Beginning in 1992 she received greater exposure as a prominent villain in <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i>, and first met best friend <a href="../../harley-quinn/29-1696/" rel="nofollow">Harley Quinn</a> in the series. Ivy's skin eventually became green rather than flesh-toned and she also received a major power upgrade, with her control over plant life increased so that she could animate plants as dangerous weapons in combat. After seemingly dying at the hands of the villainous <a href="../../hush/29-9588/" rel="nofollow">Hush</a> and being reborn, Ivy's power over the 'green world' grew to the point where she became a virtual goddess of nature. She also took on the look of a nature goddess, with her costumes becoming increasingly scanty. As Poison Ivy's popularity with readers steadily grew, she was featured as the titular character of three different one-shot issues and was finally given a starring role in the ongoing <a href="../../gotham-city-sirens/49-26891/" rel="nofollow">Gotham City Sirens</a> title in 2009. Gotham City Sirens was canceled following the DC Universe reboot in 2011, but Ivy has retained a starring role in the new <a href="../../birds-of-prey/49-42806/" rel="nofollow">Birds of Prey</a> series.</p><h3>The New 52</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/107617/2201292-bop_ivy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2201292" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.82083333333333" data-width="1440" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1440px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:82.1%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/107617/2201292-bop_ivy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2201292"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/107617/2201292-bop_ivy.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/107617/2201292-bop_ivy.jpg 1440w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/10/107617/2201292-bop_ivy.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/107617/2201292-bop_ivy.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/107617/2201292-bop_ivy.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/107617/2201292-bop_ivy.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/107617/2201292-bop_ivy.jpg 1440w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/10/107617/2201292-bop_ivy.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/107617/2201292-bop_ivy.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/107617/2201292-bop_ivy.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a></figure><p>The rebooted Ivy wears a new costume that is more modest than previous incarnations, featuring a black bodysuit with a green leaf pattern.

He learned that both of Isley's parents were now dead, but the cause of their death was never explained. Meanwhile, Poison Ivy revealed that she only became a criminal so she could fund a location where she could live with her plants in peace and away from humanity. Ivy eventually achieved this by escaping from Arkham and fleeing to an uninhabited island near the Caribbean. When she arrived there it was a wasteland, but Ivy used her powers and botanical expertise to transform it into a beautiful paradise. Ivy was able to live there quite happily until an American corporation tested their weapons on what they thought was an abandoned island. Ivy survived and returned to Gotham to exact revenge on those responsible. She once again was thwarted by Batman and ended up back in Arkham.</p><h3>The Floronic Man</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34588/720068-floroivy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-720068" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.388" data-width="250" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 250px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:138.8%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34588/720068-floroivy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-720068"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" data-width="250" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34588/720068-floroivy.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34588/720068-floroivy.jpg 250w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34588/720068-floroivy.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34588/720068-floroivy.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" data-width="250"></noscript></a></figure><p>During her second imprisonment in Arkham, Ivy received a message in some flowers that she was going to be broken out by someone that night. Two strange but formidable women named Holly and Eva successfully broke Ivy out of Arkham and brought her to their boss, the former Dr. Woodrue, who had since been transformed into the plant-like Floronic Man. This was the first time that Ivy had seen Woodrue since he had injected her with poison, and Ivy was not happy at all.</p><p>The Floronic Man made a deal with Ivy: If she gave him a sample of her DNA, he would give her a massive amount of money. He wanted to use Ivy’s DNA to create a child and flood the streets with high-powered marijuana so the child could control the world’s economy on hemp. Batman interrupted the plan but was ambushed and subdued by Holly and Eva. At this point Ivy decided to turn on the Floronic Man, freeing Batman and allowing him to go after the villain. While Batman battled and defeated the Floronic Man, Ivy successfully escaped with all of the money.</p><h3>The Earthquake of Gotham</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/711694-poisonivy05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-711694" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.502" data-width="500" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 500px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:150.2%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/711694-poisonivy05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-711694"><img alt="No Man's Land" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/711694-poisonivy05.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/711694-poisonivy05.jpg 500w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/711694-poisonivy05.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="No Man's Land" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/711694-poisonivy05.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/711694-poisonivy05.jpg 500w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/711694-poisonivy05.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>No Man's Land</figcaption></figure><p>Poison Ivy began exhibiting more human emotions during the <a href="../../no-mans-land/39-42106/" rel="nofollow">Earthquake of Gotham</a> crisis. She created a paradise in one of Gotham's major parks and raised orphans there as if they were her children. <a href="../../clayface/29-9589/" rel="nofollow">Clayface</a> approached Ivy during the winter to try and strike a deal with her, which involved her producing fruits and vegetables. The orphans would harvest them, and he would then sell them to the highest bidder. Ivy declined and instead tried to kill him with her kiss, but Clayface was able to defeat and imprison her and the children for six months. Batman arrived and freed her, and they both fought and defeated Clayface.</p><p>Batman allowed Ivy to care for the children until the disaster caused by the earthquake was over.

Ivy nursed Harley back to health, and although mistrustful of each other at first, the two women eventually became close friends. Once the city returned to normal the city council wanted Ivy out of the park because of her criminal history. They threatened to spray her garden with RC-60 which would kill Ivy and all of her plants, as well as cause harm to the children. Ivy initially refused, but after accidentally poisoning one of the children, Ivy gave herself up.</p><p>Ivy believed that her powers were causing her to kill the orphans she looked after, so she went to <a href="../../batman/29-1699/" rel="nofollow">Batman</a> and asked him to help her reverse her powers so she could be human again. The procedure was successful and Pamela Isley once again was fully human; however, this proved to be short lived.

After the events of <a href="../../final-crisis/39-51642/" rel="nofollow">Final Crisis</a>, when the new Batman (<a href="../../dick-grayson/29-1691/" rel="nofollow">Dick Grayson</a>) took back control of Gotham City, Ivy encountered Catwoman and saved her from the assault of a new super villain-wannabe who called himself <a href="../../boneblaster/29-63049/" rel="nofollow">Boneblaster</a>. Concerned at how weak Catwoman had become, she took Selina to her current residence, which also happened to be the home of Edward Nigma (the <a href="../../riddler/29-3718/" rel="nofollow">Riddler</a>). Ivy had apparently seduced and drugged Nigma with her plant pheromones, finding him a much more agreeable and tolerable person in that state. There, Selina discovered that Ivy had similarly taken Harley Quinn into her new sanctuary.</p><p>Selina offered the idea that all three of them stay together to better survive in the new Gotham City. Knowing that the magician <a href="../../zatanna/29-5691/" rel="nofollow">Zatanna</a> had once magically tampered with Catwoman's mind, Poison Ivy decided to pay her a visit via the decorative plants in Zatanna's house. Psychically channeling herself through the animated plants, Ivy was none too gentle in her interrogation of Zatanna, binding and manhandling the Mistress of Magic with plant tendrils in order to find out if she had anything to do with Selina's weakness. Zatanna denied any wrongdoing and suggested that the weakness was likely psychological in nature. Ivy returned to Selina and was about to ask her something when Boneblaster returned and tried once more to make a name for himself by attacking all of the Sirens at once. The three women defeated him, but at the cost of their sanctuary as Nigma's apartment was almost totally destroyed in the battle.</p><p>Selina obtained an abandoned animal shelter to convert into their new home. Ivy and Harley moved in, but before Ivy made a final acceptance of Selina's offer, she first demanded total honesty between all of them. Selina suddenly found herself bound to a chair with vines, and Ivy then drugged Selina with truth serum-like spores and asked her to reveal the identity of the original Batman. Selina resisted the drug thanks to a mental discipline she had learned from <a href="../../talia/29-4917/" rel="nofollow">Talia al Ghul</a>, and gave Ivy and Harley a fabricated story about the existence of multiple Batmen over the years, and that she's had a personal relationship with more than one of them. The other two women accepted this answer (though Ivy still seemed skeptical), and Ivy apologized to Selina and said that she would never drug her again. Ivy then tried to make amends by instantly growing an impressive assortment of exotic fruit for Selina's breakfast.</p><h3>Hush</h3><p>Meanwhile, Harley went off shopping. When Selina received a message on her phone that showed Harley posing with Bruce Wayne, Selina panicked and took Ivy to Harley's location. Knowing that the real Bruce was dead, Selina told Ivy that the man with Harley was really <a href="../../hush/29-9588/" rel="nofollow">Thomas Elliot</a> (the supervillain Hush). When the two arrived at the cafe where the picture was taken, all they found was a Harlequin doll at the table, its head stabbed through with a knife and Harley's abandoned cell phone lying next to it. Hush had taken Harley captive and had brought her to a restaurant atop a tall building, where he planned to push her over the edge. However, he was interrupted by two thugs in a Joker-blimp, who attacked them both. During the battle Ivy and Catwoman arrived, having heard of Harley's predicament on the news. Hush had a chance to kill his choice of the three women and somewhat convincingly pass it off as self-defense, but instead chose to save them all by shooting down the Joker-blimp.

Ivy and Catwoman attempted to follow, but Gaggy had trapped the two between closing spiked doors. Ivy animated nearby plants to jam the doors, but only managed to slow them. Catwoman then called her colleague <a href="../../jenna-duffy/29-67055/" rel="nofollow">Jenna Duffy</a> (aka the Carpenter), a gadgets expert whom the Sirens had hired to renovate their apartment. Duffy arrived just in time to free Ivy and Catwoman, and the three women tracked Gaggy to his lair. This time the Sirens defeated the villain, and Harley strapped Gaggy to a Joker-rocket and shot him out of the building. Unbeknownst to the Sirens he survived, vowing revenge on Harley.</p><h3>South American Vacation</h3><p>During the chilly Gotham Christmas season, Poison Ivy went on vacation in the South American jungle, and while enjoying the wonders of nature she contemplated her odd attraction to Gotham City and its people. Her thoughts were interrupted by cries for help from tourists, who were being targeted for assassination by militant rebels. Ivy was initially reluctant to help because no one was supposed to be in the jungle, but then saved the tourists by attacking and disarming the rebels using the jungle's powerful vines. Deciding that the rebels would simply continue their murderous ways if she freed them, she granted them no mercy, crushing them to death with her vines.</p><h3>The Alstairean</h3><p>After returning to Gotham City, Poison Ivy encountered a formidable plant-based alien humanoid from the planet Alstair. Calling himself <a href="../../the-alstairean/29-72507/" rel="nofollow">the Alstairean</a>, he seduced and manipulated Ivy into helping him conquer the Earth so his species could colonize and rule it. Combining their powers gave them unstoppable control over the plant world, and the two proceeded to take over the Earth using plant life. Ivy's friends Catwoman and Harley Quinn arrived and attempted to stop them. Poison Ivy easily defeated both of her teammates, but Harley pleaded with Ivy to reconsider what she was doing, and asked Ivy if she really wanted to side with an alien psychopath over her own friends. Ivy considered Harley's words for a moment but appeared to side with the Alstairean. She knocked Harley unconscious with plant spores and embraced the Alstairean for a romantic kiss. But in truth, these actions were a ruse. Ivy had decided to turn against the Alstairean and her kiss was a lethally poisonous one. As the Alstairean died in agony, Ivy announced that she had been in love once before only to be manipulated and used, and she would never allow that to happen again. The three women reunited as friends afterward.</p><p><b>Superboy: Smallville Attacks</b></p><p>Conner is confronted by his new best friend Simon Valentine because Simon has become aware of Conner’s secret identity. Unfortunately, Conner didn’t have time to deny Simon’s claim because Parasite appears out of nowhere and attacks them both. Parasite and Superboy tear up most of Main Street Smallville until Conner kicks Parasite into an abandoned wheat field. Superboy puts an end to Parasite by using his tactile telekinesis to manipulate the wheat grain as pummeling force to knock Parasite out. Superboy’s victory is short lived when Poison Ivy captures him with vines that are laced with Kryptonite.</p><p>Conner tries to break free but Poison Ivy keeps him docile by showing him that she has Simon under her control. Ivy explains to Conner that she is trying to save Smallville because someone in Smallville is corrupting mother Earth but she needed Conner’s help and she knew Conner wouldn’t come willingly so she hired Parasite to subdue him. Conner laughs off her explanation because he has noticed the activity in Smallville. It turns out certain sections of town are being overrun by unusual vegetation. Leaving Ivy with no other choice, she seduces Conner with her pheromones thus making him a bit more compliant.</p><p>Krypto arrives on the scene and he remembers Ivy from their last encounter when Hush was ruining Batman’s life. Ivy asks Krypto to trust her and even though the situation didn’t smell right, he allowed Ivy to leave with Conner. Ivy tells Krypto to guard Parasite and protect Simon until they return. Krypto reluctantly agrees to her request. As soon as Ivy left with Conner, her hold over Simon began to fade. Simon takes this opportunity by extracting some of Parasite’s blood in order to discover weaknesses that Superboy may not be aware of and perhaps bend Parasite’s blood to his will.</p><p>Ivy and Conner arrive at a farmhouse that seems to be the epicenter of the peculiar greenery. Conner uses his x-ray vision to locate any signs of life while at the same time scoping out Ivy since her pheromones haven’t exactly worn off. Ivy notices Conner’s wanton stare and just as she was about to flirt with him, Conner spots a person that is hanging in the farmhouse. They discover old man Gilliam has a series of wires sticking out of his chest. Superboy follows the wires to a machine that is fitted with a timer which is set to go off in five minutes. Conner doesn’t know what to do because yanking out the wires might kill the old man or set off the device.</p><p>Ivy on the other hand, didn’t care about the old man so she ripped out the wires which caused the vegetation in one section of town to die off but the old man died from post traumatic shock. Ivy loses her control over Conner because his rage and moral perspective finally counter acted her pheromones. Ivy uses her Kryptonite vines to take down Conner. Fortunately, Simon used Parasite’s blood on some of his experimental frogs. Their mucus like skin emitted the Parasite’s absorbing abilities and Simon controlled the frogs by via remote control. The Parasite frogs converged on Ivy and within seconds, Ivy fainted after being drained of her powers.</p><p>With Ivy down for the count, Superboy decides to destroy the machine but the machine’s timer reaches zero and everything within the farmhouse disappears. Conner carries Ivy back to Smallville while Simon heads back home with his newly enhanced amphibians. When Simon made his way back home, he notices a strange rock with ancient runes on it but before he could investigate further, he was scared off by a posse of weird looking farmers.</p><h3><i>New 52</i></h3><h3>The Dark Knight- Knight Terrors</h3><p><b>For more information see: <a href="/batman-the-dark-knight-knight-terrors/4050-53222/" data-ref-id="4050-53222">Knight Terrors</a></b></p><p>While Batman is tracking down the person responsible for injecting several Arkham Asylum inmates with a mixture of Plant-life, Venom and Scarecrow's fear gas, he learns that Ivy has been kidnapped.

The natural oils that her body produces are laced with biochemical toxins, so the very touch of her skin can poison a normal human if she so chooses. She has also developed several toxins which serve different purposes, including a truth serum and a love potion. She can easily mesmerize and manipulate people, particularly men, by using her special pheromones. Poison Ivy has complete mental control over all forms of plant life, allowing her to animate them to attack and ensnare her opponents, and even to create powerful new plant hybrids for specialized purposes.</p><p>She has a special relationship with plants. She treats them as if they were her children and they respond to her will and command. Her expertise as a biochemist has allowed her to develop mutant plants and to create and bring to life plants that were long thought to be extinct. Ivy's connection with "the green world" is said to be on par with supernatural beings such as <a href="../../swamp-thing/29-15809/" rel="nofollow">Swamp Thing</a>. Ivy can also hear plants when they are in agony and this drives her crazy.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38078/871041-zee_004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-871041" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.2875" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:28.8%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38078/871041-zee_004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-871041"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38078/871041-zee_004.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38078/871041-zee_004.jpg 1280w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/38078/871041-zee_004.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/38078/871041-zee_004.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38078/871041-zee_004.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38078/871041-zee_004.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38078/871041-zee_004.jpg 1280w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/38078/871041-zee_004.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/38078/871041-zee_004.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38078/871041-zee_004.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a></figure><p>Since her death and rebirth, Ivy's command over plant life has increased to the point where she can literally grow giant animated plants from seedlings in a matter of seconds. She has incorporated living vines into her costume which she can utilize as powerful extra limbs when in combat. She is now able to hear through plants, as was shown in Gotham City Sirens #4, when she tracked her friend Harley Quinn - who had been kidnapped - entirely through plants. A recent impressive use of her power is to channel her consciousness into plant material even at great distances, growing and animating it into a formidable plant avatar under her control. She can hear and speak through the avatar as well as act physically through it. This power was demonstrated when she captured and interrogated Zatanna in her own home by growing a plant avatar from the cut roses inside the house, even though Ivy herself was elsewhere in the city.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4759/125317-107262-poison-ivy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-125317" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.835" data-width="400" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 400px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:83.5%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4759/125317-107262-poison-ivy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-125317"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4759/125317-107262-poison-ivy.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4759/125317-107262-poison-ivy.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4759/125317-107262-poison-ivy.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4759/125317-107262-poison-ivy.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4759/125317-107262-poison-ivy.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4759/125317-107262-poison-ivy.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a></figure><p>Surviving the exotic plant toxins injected into her by the Floronic Man also altered Ivy's physiology in more subtle ways. She has far greater durability and resistance to injury than a normal human and is unusually agile, being able to effortlessly climb most surfaces much like her ivy namesake. She is also unusually strong, possessing three times the strength of a female athlete of her same height, weight, and build. She is at home in the water and is a fast and powerful swimmer. Ivy has learned a limited style of martial arts combat and can handle herself quite well in a fight, even when not using her other powers. Ivy's enhanced physiology is dependent on receiving a certain amount of sunlight, which she absorbs and converts to energy in much the same way plants do (and is part of the reason for her greenish skin tone). She becomes greatly weakened if deprived of sunlight for an extended period of time.</p><p>Though mentally unstable, Ivy possesses a genius-level intellect, particularly regarding anything related to plants, and may be the world's foremost botanical expert.</p><p> </p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Animation</h3><h4><a href="/batman-the-animated-series/4075-17/" data-ref-id="4075-17">Batman: The Animated Series</a> (1992-1995)</h4><p>Poison Ivy made her debut in the first season episode <i>Pretty Poison</i> and became a recurring villain in the series.

She now wore a distinctive rose-shaped hairstyle along with a leaf-like green miniskirt. She was younger than any previous incarnation of the character, being a high school student and best friend of <a href="../../oracle/29-5368/" rel="nofollow">Barbara Gordon</a>. In school, Pamela Isley was an environmental activist who was repeatedly sent to a youth detention center for staging disruptive protests. She was later revealed to be plotting missions of eco-terrorism against offending corporations, and accidentally came into contact with a toxic plant-based mutagen during one such mission. This caused her to manifest greenish skin and plant-based powers, which she used to further her career as an eco-terrorist. Calling herself Poison Ivy, she came into conflict with both Batman and her former best friend Barbara, who had become Batgirl. This version of Ivy was voiced by actress Piera Coppola.</p><p> </p><h4><a href="/batman-the-brave-and-the-bold/4075-109/" data-ref-id="4075-109">Batman: The Brave and the Bold</a> (2008-2011)</h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1673028-poisonivy_anim_batmanb_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1673028" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.63871951219512" data-width="656" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 656px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:63.9%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1673028-poisonivy_anim_batmanb_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1673028"><img alt="Batman: The Brave and the Bold" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/1673028-poisonivy_anim_batmanb_b.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1673028-poisonivy_anim_batmanb_b.jpg 656w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/29837/1673028-poisonivy_anim_batmanb_b.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/1673028-poisonivy_anim_batmanb_b.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="Batman: The Brave and the Bold" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/1673028-poisonivy_anim_batmanb_b.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1673028-poisonivy_anim_batmanb_b.jpg 656w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/29837/1673028-poisonivy_anim_batmanb_b.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/1673028-poisonivy_anim_batmanb_b.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman: The Brave and the Bold</figcaption></figure><p>Poison Ivy was redesigned yet again for this latest Batman animated series, becoming more shapely and mature like her first animated appearance, but this time with greenish skin. She appeared along with other Batman villains in the episode <i>Chill of the Night</i>. In this appearance she was voiced by actress Jennifer Hale, who also voiced the animated Zatanna. Her second appearance was in <em>The Masks of Matches Malone,</em> voiced by Vanessa Marshall. After taking over Gotham City, Ivy offered Batman a chance to live if he agreed to marry her, but he refused. Ivy then ordered him fed to her pet, a giant Venus Flytrap, but the heroine <a href="../../black-orchid/29-5702/" rel="nofollow">Black Orchid</a> (who had earlier taken out and replaced one of Ivy's female guards) intervened, rescuing Batman and destroying the plant in the process. Infuriated, Ivy took out Black Orchid and captured Batman a second time, making him one last offer to either become her husband or die at her hands. As Batman again refused, Black Orchid recovered and knocked Ivy unconscious. She appeared in minor roles in several other episodes such as <i>Crisis: 22,300 Miles Above the Earth</i>. Alongside virtually every other character to appear in the show, she also made a cameo in the final scene of <i>Mitefall</i>, the series finale.</p><h4><a href="/young-justice/4075-33/" data-ref-id="4075-33">Young Justice</a> (2010-2013)</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/5017088-poison_ivy.png" data-ref-id="1300-5017088" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="400" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 400px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/5017088-poison_ivy.png" data-ref-id="1300-5017088"><img alt="Poison Ivy in Young Justice" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/5017088-poison_ivy.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/5017088-poison_ivy.png 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/5017088-poison_ivy.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="Poison Ivy in Young Justice" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/5017088-poison_ivy.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/5017088-poison_ivy.png 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/5017088-poison_ivy.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Poison Ivy in Young Justice</figcaption></figure><p>Poison Ivy appears in the episode "Revelations," sporting a design that seems like an updated, more detailed version of her appearance from <i>The New Batman Adventures</i>.

She appears in a level called <i>No Green Peace</i>, which borrows elements from Ivy's animated series episodes <i>Pretty Poison</i> and <i>Eternal Youth</i>. In the game, Batman must defeat Ivy's gigantic Venus Flytrap plant in her private greenhouse. It is the only level in the game where Batman is forced to use his batarangs to attack his enemies rather than his fists. This is partly due to the fact that all of the enemies the player encounters are female (including the lower-level ones) and it would be considered abusive to physically strike them.</p><p> </p><h4><strong>The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin (1994)</strong></h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/5017114-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-5017114" data-ratio="0.234375" data-width="256" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 256px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:23.4%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/5017114-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-5017114"><img alt="Ivy in The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" data-width="256" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/5017114-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/5017114-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg 256w"><noscript><img alt="Ivy in The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/5017114-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/5017114-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.jpg 256w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" data-width="256"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ivy in The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin</figcaption></figure><p>Poison Ivy is one of the enemy bosses in this game.

The only man to ever match the Pirate King Gold Roger in a fight. He ate the Tremor-Tremor devil fruit that turned him into a "Quake Man" and gave him the power to create destructive earthquakes. He was one of the four emperors that rule over the new world, the second half of the grand line.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p> </p><h2>Youth</h2><p>Not much is know of Newgate's past, but in his youth he was once just like any other pirate, serving on a another mans ship, with a dream, but his dream was quite different from any other pirates. Edward was not interested in treasure like others around him, who felt it weird, that a pirate was not interested in treasure. When they asked what he was interested in. Newgate replied Family.</p><h2>Age Of Gol D. Roger</h2><p>In time Newgate would build a crew of his own, which he named the <a href="http://www.animevice.com/whitebeard-pirates/22-410/" rel="nofollow"> Whitebeard Pirates</a>. Building it to become not only one of the largest pirate crews, but also a crew with a bind greater than any other. Truly making his dreams of a family come true. It is not known how there rivalry began but during the age of the pirate kind, Whitebeard and his crew would begin rivalry with Gol D. Roger and the jolly roger pirates, the two meets many times. In fact Whitebeard is the only man to have tied with the late pirate king. During these many fights Whitebeard was often challenged by the younger <a href="http://www.animevice.com/buggy-the-clown/18-14896/" rel="nofollow"> Buggy</a> and<a href="http://www.animevice.com/shanks/18-21532/" rel="nofollow"> Shanks</a>. Despite their intense rivalry, the two men had a respect for one another, even drinking on an island after Gol made it to <a href="http://www.animevice.com/raftel/23-182/" rel="nofollow"> Raftel</a>, were Gol told Newgate the meaning of the Will of D.</p><p>After the execution of Gol, the Lion Shiki escaped from his prison in impel down. He then met up with Whitebeard. Shiki told Newgate that it was his time now that Gol was gone. Whitebeard not amused by Shiki, tells him to cut the crap, even threatening him by throwing him overboard. Shiki, responds by laughing, and tells Newgate that he's leaving for awhile, saying he's gonna show the rookies, the real fear of pirates. Whitebeard responds by saying plotting something again.</p><p><u><b>A New Age</b></u></p><p>After the age of Gol D. Roger had ended, his final words spurred a new generation of pirates, beginning the start of the great pirate age. Newgate began being referred to as one of the 4 Great Pirate Emperors known as the Yonkou, along with Shanks, Kaidou, and an unknown 4th. Unlike the <a href="http://www.animevice.com/marines/22-331/" rel="nofollow"> Marines</a> and the <a href="http://www.animevice.com/shichibukai/22-242/" rel="nofollow"> Shichibukai</a>, these 4 held no alliance. At some point in time, Whitebeard went to fishman island, and freed it from constant attacks and slavery.</p><p>When his future son <a href="http://www.animevice.com/portgas-d-ace/18-23647/" rel="nofollow"> Portgas D. Ace</a> set of on his journey, as the captain of the spade pirates. Newgate caught Ace in the paper, referring that he was a promising "young'un", and that he has rejected te status as Shichibukai, but also claimed that he was in a hurry. Whitebeard would then hear that Ace had been searching for him, as he planned to kill him. After the fight between Ace and Jimbei, the Whitebeard pirates showed up. Newgate battled the Spade crew himself, easily outmatching the rookie group, but Ace created a fire wall in order to protect his friends. Whitebeard defeated Ace, but impressed by his resilience offered him a place on his crew, which was rejected. Still Ace was taken aboard the Moby Dick.</p><p>After Ace was captured, the spade pirates attempted to rescue their captain, but they too were again defeated and taken aboard. While he was aboard Newgate's ship, Ace would constantly try to kill the captain, but time and time again Whitebeard was able to fend of the atttacks. In time Ace came around, and became another son of Whitebeard. When Ace told Newgate of his true heritage, Whitebeard just laghed, and said that they were nothing alike. Ace asked if Whitebeard was going to throw him off the ship, being Gol D. Rogers son, but Whitebeard told Ace that no matter who brought you into the world, were all still sons and daughters of the sea. In fact while aboard his crew Witebeard knew Ace would be safe from the hands of the world government. Soon after this, Marshal D. Teach who would become Blackbeard broke the number one rule and killed a fellow namaka for a devil fruit. Despite his protests against Ace seeking revenge, he was unable to stop his son. </p><p>Meeting With Shanks </p><p>After Ace went in search of Teach. A member of the red haired pirates.....Rockstar boared the Moby Dick, in order to deliver a letter to Newgate from his captain Shanks. Unimpressed that Shanks did not come in person, Whitebeard ripped the letter up. Angering Rockstar, that he had ripped the letter up, but he already knew what it was about. His nurses also told him to stop drinking but he did not. Whitebeard told Rockstar that Shanks should come himself, and that he didn't want to talk to some little kid with a runny nose. </p><p>Soon after Rockstar told his captain of what happened. Shanks decided to go and meet with Whitebeard himself. The marines tried to prevent the two crews from meeting, fearing what would happen if two Yonkou formed an alliance. Despite this Shanks was able to board Whitebeards ship, were he showed his strong spirit. Shanks claimed that he had brought Newgate some healing water and that he was not there to fight. Whitebeard asks his crew to leave the two men alone, responding that the sake Shanks brought from west blue was not very good. Though Shanks assured him it was good Sake, which upon drinking it Newgate agreed. The two men begin to talk about the past, 22 years ago. About how Shanks had grown to be a strong pirate, and how he was always seen with Buggy during the battles of the Whitebeard crew and the Jolly Roger pirates. Whitebeard aska Shanks how he lost his arm, which Shanks answers by saying he betted it on the new age. Soon the conversation changes to the topic of Blackbeard, were Shanks tells Newgate that it was Teach who gave him the wound on his eye. Shanks asks Whitebeard not to have Ace go after Teach, and that it's best if they stay out of his way. Newgate says that Shanks is 100 years to early to order him around. The two men then draw their weapons and clash, with the very sky itself splitting. </p><h3><u>War With The Marines</u></h3><p><u><b>Gura Gura No Mi</b></u></p><p>This is a paramecia devil fruit, which was consumed by Edward Newgate at an unknown point in time, and is his primary power in the series. This gives Whitebeard the nickname quake man, and the devil fruit allows him to create shock waves. Fleet Admiral <a href="http://www.animevice.com/sengoku/18-25502/" rel="nofollow"> Sengoku</a> stated that this devil fruit gives Whitebeard the power to destroy the world. This devil fruit has been shown to be incredibly strong. Able to create giant shock waves through the ground, waters and even the air. When this is done, the air usually cracks. These shock waves are so great, during the <a href="http://www.animevice.com/marineford/23-187/" rel="nofollow"> Marineford </a>war, those on other islands could feel it's effects.</p><p>Using the Gura-Gura no mi. Newgate has shown the power to create large tsunami's, and even split the entire island of Marineford in two, leaving a large chasm in the middle. This attack is strong enough to practically take out most enemies in a single blow. Even Akainu was quickly subdued by it's powers. In fact it took 3 admirals, to nullify one of Whitebeard's shock waves. While it offers a great offense, the use of this devil fruit also gives a great defense. Able to cancel out other attacks, and break free from capture, such as when Newgate broke free from <a href="http://www.animevice.com/aokiji/18-22411/" rel="nofollow"> Aokiji</a>'s ice prison. Whitebeard can also focus his shock waves into a single point, forming a bubble around his hand or his bisento. When released it creates a small explosion, which is strong enough to instantly take down two Marine giants. Finally, Whitebeard can move entire islands, tilting them.</p><p><u><b>Strengths</b></u></p><p>On top of his devil fruit power. Whitebeard is also in great physical condition, though it has diminished as he has gotten older. First of all Newgate has incredible physical strength. During his fight against one of the marine giants, he was able to stop a blow of the giants sword with his bisento. This was an impressive feat as the giant was using both of his arms while Whitebeard needed only one to stop the mighty blow. He was also able to stop a moving ship with one hand. Though it has pretty much deserted him Newgate back in the day had amazing reflexes, able to dodge multiple attempts on his life at the hands of Ace, even while sleeping. Finally he has amazing durability, having half his face burned off, being stabbed and shot multiple times and still surviving. </p>]]></description><first_appeared_in_issue><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-512142/]]></api_detail_url><id>512142</id><name><![CDATA[No. 29, 2002]]></name><issue_number>1693</issue_number></first_appeared_in_issue><gender>1</gender><id>69573</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/1320784-whitebeard_profile.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/1320784-whitebeard_profile.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/1320784-whitebeard_profile.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/1320784-whitebeard_profile.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/1320784-whitebeard_profile.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/1320784-whitebeard_profile.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/1320784-whitebeard_profile.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Whitebeard]]></name><origin><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/origin/4030-4/]]></api_detail_url><id>4</id><name><![CDATA[Human]]></name></origin><publisher><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/publisher/4010-1867/]]></api_detail_url><id>1867</id><name><![CDATA[Shueisha]]></name></publisher><real_name><![CDATA[Edward Newgate]]></real_name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/whitebeard/4005-69573/]]></site_detail_url><resource_type><![CDATA[character]]></resource_type></character><character><aliases><![CDATA[The Project]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/character/4005-57063/]]></api_detail_url><birth/><count_of_issue_appearances>5</count_of_issue_appearances><date_added>2008-08-21 17:37:59</date_added><date_last_updated>2013-10-10 18:24:01</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Piecemeal is a cybernetic monster created by scientists under the rule of the Red Skull.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p>One day, the Red Skull minions captured a spy who had been sent to investigate his organization by the Commission On Superhuman Activities.
