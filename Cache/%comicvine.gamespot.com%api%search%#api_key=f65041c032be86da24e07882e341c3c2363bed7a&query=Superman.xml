Professor Chill and the super top secret organization known as <a href="/nightwing/4060-45130/" data-ref-id="4060-45130">Nightwing</a>, were responsible for the creation of The Atom; Earth-9's first superhero. Nightwing wanted to build upon the success they had with the Atom, by turning America into a nation of super-powered beings. They sought to end the Cold War by making America more advanced then the rest of the world, in every way possible. Professor Chill, who worked for Nightwing, chose to test the "Miracle Solution" on the small town of Viceroy, South Carolina. Viceroy had a population of 803 people, most of them were African-American. The Miracle Solution was released into the town's water supply. A year and a half later, half the town was found screaming in severe pain "as their brains turned to jelly."</p><p>Harvey Dent came into this world under unusual circumstances. A dozen high ranking military officials attended his birth. They were heavily armed and prepared to kill Harvey, if he came out his mother attacking. They were expecting the worst because the "Miracle Solution" had mutated or killed everyone else who had been exposed to it. They hoped that Harvey would display evolved super-powers. To the Nightwing's dismay, Harvey came out a seemingly normal 9lb baby boy. Harvey's mother died giving birth, and Harvey's father was grotesquely mutated and it is assumed that he died as well.</p><p>At the age of 23, Harvey became a police officer or the city of New York. He had a phobia of heights, but sometimes his job required him to overcome his fear.. One day Harvey was assigned to persuade a man from committing suicide. The man had planned to jump from the top of Earth-9's tallest building. Harvey overcame his phobia of heights and met the man on the building's roof top. Harvey talked to the man until he was close enough to place a hand cuff on the man's arm. Harvey told the man if wanted to jump, he would have to take Harvey with him. The man called Harvey's bluff and jumped. One survived, the other did not.</p><p>Harvey survived the fall to the amazement of medical personnel. The man who fell with him was unable to be identified; even by his dental records. The weeks following his fall; Harvey's powers began to emerge. Prior to his powers emerging, Harvey could not "wire an electric plug" and found books like "Dr. Seuss challenging." All that changed when Harvey's powers emerged. He now was able to read all the books in the local library; in one week. He also took apart and re-built everything he had in his apartment.</p><p>Black Orchid gave Harvey the location of Nightwing's HQ. Harvey wanted answers about how he became to be the "most powerful man in the world." After scanning Nightwing's computer databases with his mind, Harvey found what he was looking for and more. It is assumed that Harvey killed everyone in the building. Harvey had obtained the instructions to create the Miracle Solution. Harvey perfected the process of the Miracle Solution and dubbed the results, the "Miracle Pill'. The pill would grant any person the same powers as Harvey. Harvey's wife, Lola Dent, took the Miracle Pill. It appeared that she did not survive.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>JLA</h3><p>In this story arc, Harvey teams up with the heroes of Earth-9 to form the JLA. Their team consisted of: <a href="/atom-thompson/4005-45113/" data-ref-id="4005-45113">Atom</a>, <a href="/bat-man/4005-45117/" data-ref-id="4005-45117">Bat-Man</a>, <a href="/green-lantern/4005-45112/" data-ref-id="4005-45112">Green Lantern</a>, and <a href="/wonder-woman/4005-45118/" data-ref-id="4005-45118">Wonder Woman</a>.</p><h3>Crisis on Infinite Earths</h3><h3>Superman's Reign</h3><p>The Superman's Reign takes place 10 years after Harvey discovered he had super powers. In this time frame, Harvey has managed to take over his world (Earth -9). Earth-9 is replica of our own Earth; however, the technologies of Earth-9 are more advanced. The <a href="/ultra-humanite/4005-79642/" data-ref-id="4005-79642">Ultra-Humanite</a>; the most powerful villain on Earth-9, had knocked out the power of the entire world and defeated all the armies of Earth-9. Harvey defeated the Ultra-Humanite with a display of raw power. The battle between Harvey and the Ultra-Humanite took place on the moon. The Atom suggest that the Earth would have been destroyed had the battle been fought there instead of the moon. After the death of Harvey's wife, Harvey appeared at the United Nations headquarters (on his world) and announced that he will be running the planet. Harvey also took over the Nightwing; the organization responsible for Harvey's powers. Harvey is now in command of Nightwing soldiers which are called Firestorm Troopers. Harvey also has access to the Question. The Question is a machine that is capable of world wide surveillance. Harvey then went on to marry <a href="/powergirl/4005-45115/" data-ref-id="4005-45115">Powergirl</a> of Earth-9. Together they conquered their world in order to save it.</p><p>Harvey sought to rid society of centuries old problems. Issues like poverty, war, and crime were all abolished under Harvey's dictatorship. The heroes of Earth-9 tried to challenge Harvey's rule. Many of the heroes were jailed, subjected to telepathic interrogations, or in the worst case scenario, killed. Harvey was the most powerful man on the planet. To challenge his authority was futile.</p><p>Earth-9 had its own heroes with the same names as New Earth's heroes and villains; however, Earth-9's heroes had much different powers and backgrounds. The Green Lantern of Earth-9 possessed a "green lantern" that acted as a means of transportation between New Earth and Earth-9. This is how <a href="/wally-west/4005-23879/" data-ref-id="4005-23879">Wally West</a> and <a href="/john-stewart/4005-10451/" data-ref-id="4005-10451">John Stewart</a> originally came to Earth-9. A team of superheroes from New Earth went to Earth-9 in search of John and Flash. The team included <a href="/batman/4005-1699/" data-ref-id="4005-1699">Batman</a>, <a href="/hal-jordan/4005-11202/" data-ref-id="4005-11202">Hal Jordan</a>, <a href="/black-lightning/4005-10994/" data-ref-id="4005-10994">Black Lightning</a>, and <a href="/black-canary/4005-1689/" data-ref-id="4005-1689">Black Canary</a>. By the time they got to Earth-9, Harvey had already went to New Earth. Harvey had taken John Stewart's' ring and used it in combination with Orion's warping power to travel to New Earth.</p><p>Harvey and Superman fought with Harvey getting the better of the exchange. Harvey proceeded with his plan to take over New Earth. Harvey had taken all the leaders of New Earth hostage. He destroyed the White House and the Capital building. He also destroyed many of New Earth's capital cities. Next, Harvey took control of the nuclear weapons of Russia, China and Pakistan. New Earth was on the verge of annihilation.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28079/894071-tangent___superman_s_reign_vol._2_tp__2009__01_.png" data-ref-id="1300-894071" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.5184615384615" data-width="650" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 650px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:151.8%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28079/894071-tangent___superman_s_reign_vol._2_tp__2009__01_.png" data-ref-id="1300-894071"><img alt="Tangent: Superman's Reign #11, by Ivan Reis." src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28079/894071-tangent___superman_s_reign_vol._2_tp__2009__01_.png" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28079/894071-tangent___superman_s_reign_vol._2_tp__2009__01_.png 650w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28079/894071-tangent___superman_s_reign_vol._2_tp__2009__01_.png 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28079/894071-tangent___superman_s_reign_vol._2_tp__2009__01_.png 421w" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px" data-width="421"></a><figcaption>Tangent: Superman's Reign #11, by Ivan Reis.</figcaption></figure><p>Harvey then made an alliance with the super villains of New Earth. Harvey's new allies included <a href="/lex-luthor/4005-41952/" data-ref-id="4005-41952">Lex Luthor</a>, <a href="/black-manta/4005-8345/" data-ref-id="4005-8345">Black Manta</a>, <a href="/dr-psycho/4005-4918/" data-ref-id="4005-4918">Dr. Psycho</a>, <a href="/scarecrow/4005-3726/" data-ref-id="4005-3726">Scarecrow</a>, <a href="/joker/4005-1702/" data-ref-id="4005-1702">Joker</a>, <a href="/poison-ivy/4005-1697/" data-ref-id="4005-1697">Poison Ivy</a> and <a href="/mr-freeze/4005-3715/" data-ref-id="4005-3715">Mister Freeze</a>. Harvey also had Powergirl and Orion of Earth-9 to do his bidding. Batman later finds the weapon he was looking for; Harvey's supposedly dead wife. Harvey had led his Earth to believe that his wife died. All the while she was in hiding. She had been evolving and growing stronger. Lola Dent was not the only being Harvey pretended to be dead. The Ultra-Humanite was still alive and now the powerful creature was under Harvey's control.</p><p>The villains of New Earth soon turned against Harvey. Harvey found himself fighting a multitude of super-powered beings. Powergirl and Orion had been defeated and Bat-Man sacrificed himself to defeat the Ultra-Humanite. Lex Luthor managed to deactivate all of Harvey's nuclear warheads. Harvey was now on his own.</p><p>Harvey made his final confrontation with <a href="/superman/4005-1807/" data-ref-id="4005-1807">Superman</a>. Harvey had stopped Superman's heart from beating and his brain and lungs from functioning. Clark was on his knees writhing in pain. Before Harvey could do anymore damage, Superman was freed from Harvey's hold by none other than Lola Dent; Harvey's ex-wife. It took a combination of New Earth's heroes (and villains), Earth-9's heroes, and Harvey's ex-wife, to bring Superman's reign to an end. Earth-9's Green Lantern imprisoned Harvey, Ultra-Humanite, Powergirl and Orion in the prison that Harvey had created for the Ultra-Humanite. Earth-9's Green Lantern then sent them to a far away land, never to be heard from again.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Harvey Dent has unrivaled telekinetic powers. He has used his telekinesis, in combination with his superb intellect, to alter his physiology and grant himself new powers. His telekinetic abilities were able to effortlessly restrain John Stewart and prevent John from being able to use his ring. He also took control of Guy Gardner's ring and forced him to attack Hal Jordan and John Stewart.</p><h3>Other telekinetic feats of Harvey are:</h3><p>Harvey placed an entire naval fleet on land.</p><p>He lifted an aircraft carrier out of the water and carried it away as if it “had wings.”</p><p>Harvey's TK shields are strong enough to take blows from Superman.</p><p>Harvey contained the fall out of a nuclear bomb using his TK shields.</p><p>He stopped Superman's lungs and heart from functioning</p><h3>Harvey's other abilities:</h3><p>Harvey is a masterful technopath (has the ability to communicate with machines). Harvey is able to scan emails with his mind and store the information in his memory. Harvey can also download computer hard drives using only his mind. Harvey has used his technopathic abilities to fly a squadron of fighter jets that did not have pilots. Mr. Dent is also a powerful telepath. He has been shown to read and erase minds without effort. Harvey can also sense the presence of super powered beings anywhere on the planet.</p><p>Harvey possesses the ability to see the future or ESP. He demonstrates this ability when he tells his wife that he knew she would have an affair before she did it. Another instance is when New Earth's heroes were surprised that Harvey was predicting their moves. Wally West stated that Harvey Dent "knows everything!"</p><p>Harvey once used his powers to power the city of New York (Earth-9). This feat was likely a combination of Harvey’s telekinetic and technopathic abilities or it maybe that he has some control over electricity. It should be noted that Harvey has destroyed several buildings by manipulating the electrical currents within the walls of the buildings.</p><p>Other abilities of Harvey are that he is able to sense beings that are in alternate realities, He can also learn a century’s worth of knowledge in a hour. Harvey has shown the ability to teleport and is said to be 1,000,000 times more evolved than that of an average human.</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>Harvey carries a staff. He does not use the staff in combat. The staff is more than likely a part of his persona. Harvey views himself as a shepherd.to humanity.</p>]]></description><first_appeared_in_issue><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-120433/]]></api_detail_url><id>120433</id><name/><issue_number>1</issue_number></first_appeared_in_issue><gender>1</gender><id>45116</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/1007303-the_superman__04__018__01_.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/1007303-the_superman__04__018__01_.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/1007303-the_superman__04__018__01_.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/1007303-the_superman__04__018__01_.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/1007303-the_superman__04__018__01_.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/1007303-the_superman__04__018__01_.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/1007303-the_superman__04__018__01_.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Superman]]></name><origin><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/origin/4030-9/]]></api_detail_url><id>9</id><name><![CDATA[Other]]></name></origin><publisher><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/publisher/4010-638/]]></api_detail_url><id>638</id><name><![CDATA[Tangent Comics]]></name></publisher><real_name><![CDATA[Harvey Dent]]></real_name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/superman/4005-45116/]]></site_detail_url><resource_type><![CDATA[character]]></resource_type></character><character><aliases><![CDATA[Kal-El

Contrary to his current incarnation, he first appeared as a bald, telepathic villain bent on dominating the world. He was called "Super-Man" in the short science fiction fanzine "<em>The Reign of the Super-Man</em>" which was published by the duo in 1933. Siegel and Shuster decided to re-write the character as a hero and took out the hyphen, renaming him Superman and re-imagining him with no resemblance to his earlier incarnation.</p><p>Their early attempts to sell the concept of the character were notably unsuccessful. For instance, Siegel attempted to sell the story to <a href="/tip-top-comics/4050-1831/" data-ref-id="4050-1831">Tip Top Comics</a> but it was rejected as too fanciful and not what comic book readers would be interested in.

They also changed his motivations from trying to conquer the world to trying to make it a better place, fighting against the injustices like <a href="/adolf-hitler/4005-9671/" data-ref-id="4005-9671">Hitler</a> and <a href="/josef-stalin/4005-28624/" data-ref-id="4005-28624">Stalin</a> in addition to everyday crime. Shuster and Siegel intended to make the character as colorful and distinctive as they could, drawing inspiration from the outfits worn by space characters in pulp <a href="/pm/detail/4259659/superman/#">magazines</a> as well as the traditional outfit worn by circus strong-men, which informed the look of almost every superhero thereafter. Being avid movie fans, Siegel and Shuster gave the character the civilian name of Clark Kent, combining the names of actors Clark Gable and Kent Taylor and partly basing the character on Harold Lloyd.</p><p>It has also been stated that Shuster based Superman's looks upon actor Douglass Fairbanks. The pair decided to feature Superman in the then dominant comic-strip format and were finally able sell their creation to <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dc-comics/4010-10/" data-ref-id="4010-10"><em>Detective Comics</em></a>, later known as <a href="/dc-comics/4010-10/" data-ref-id="4010-10">DC Comics</a> where they would produce comic books featuring him for several years. In June of 1938, Superman made his debut in <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/action-comics-1-superman-champion-of-the-oppressed/4000-105403/" data-ref-id="4000-105403"><em>Action Comics #1</em></a> and since then he has become not only one of the most famous and iconic super-heroes of all time but also one of the most popular fictional characters ever.</p><p>Many comics historians and various scholars have also noted various influences on the Superman character from religion and mythology. Siegel and Shuster were avid fans of science fiction and work such as the <a href="/john-carter/4005-34103/" data-ref-id="4005-34103">John Carter</a> series bare a resemblance to early Superman, as do elements from Jewish religion and mythology (Siegel and Shuster being the sons of Jewish immigrants) such as Moses, and the guardian creature of Jewish folklore, the Golem. Superman was based on 3 people,either mythological or fiction, <a href="/buck-rogers/4005-52202/" data-ref-id="4005-52202">Buck Rogers</a>, <a href="/moses/4005-34058/" data-ref-id="4005-34058">Moses</a> and <a href="/hercules/4005-67267/" data-ref-id="4005-67267">Hercules</a>. Early in his publication history, Superman, like many heroic characters of the time, was used by the United States government as a tool of propaganda during World War II. It was then that he was first presented as a being who embodied the American ideals of Truth, Justice and Liberty.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3>Golden Age</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-2166637" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2166637-80536_18005_105403_1_action_comics_super.jpg" data-ratio="0.99749373433584" data-width="399" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 399px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:99.7%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2166637-80536_18005_105403_1_action_comics_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2166637"><img alt="Golden Age Superman by Joe Shuster " src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101435/2166637-80536_18005_105403_1_action_comics_super.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2166637-80536_18005_105403_1_action_comics_super.jpg 399w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101435/2166637-80536_18005_105403_1_action_comics_super.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="Golden Age Superman by Joe Shuster " src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101435/2166637-80536_18005_105403_1_action_comics_super.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2166637-80536_18005_105403_1_action_comics_super.jpg 399w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101435/2166637-80536_18005_105403_1_action_comics_super.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Golden Age Superman by Joe Shuster </figcaption></figure><p>In the <a href="/golden-age-of-comics/4015-55820/" data-ref-id="4015-55820">Golden Age</a> of Superman, <a href="/jor-l/4005-63062/" data-ref-id="4005-63062">Jor-L</a>, a scientist of the planet Krypton, discovers that his planet is about to explode. He attempts to warn his fellow scientists of this impending catastrophe, but is dismissed as a crack-pot and laughed out of the scientific community.

As he matures, great powers began to manifest and before his parents’ deaths, they dub him Superman and urge him to use his powers for the forces of justice. His parents pass on and he moves to Metropolis to begin his career at the Daily Star (later known as the <a href="/daily-planet/4020-55695/" data-ref-id="4020-55695">Daily Planet</a>) so that he could hear about trouble as it’s happening.

After the Cyborg shows his true nature as a genocidal maniac, the Eradicator joins with Superman, thus returning his powers and allowing him to triumph.</p><h3><a href="/last-son/4045-57171/" data-ref-id="4045-57171"><em>Last Son</em></a></h3><p>A Meteor is about to crash in Metropolis and Superman stops it only to discover</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-2407379" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58664/2407379-christopher_kent.jpg" data-ratio="1.668" data-width="250" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 250px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:166.8%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58664/2407379-christopher_kent.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2407379"><img alt="Lor-Zod" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" data-width="250" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58664/2407379-christopher_kent.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58664/2407379-christopher_kent.jpg 250w"><noscript><img alt="Lor-Zod" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58664/2407379-christopher_kent.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58664/2407379-christopher_kent.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" data-width="250"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lor-Zod</figcaption></figure><p>that its actually a pod carrying a young boy. The Department of Metahuman Affairs meets with Superman about the boy, whom he learns is Kryptonian. Superman takes a personal interest in the child, and is concerned over what the government might do to him. His concerns are proved justified when the boy is transferred without Superman's knowledge. Enraged, Superman disguises himself to grab the kid from a moving van and goes to the <a href="/kent-farm/4020-56265/" data-ref-id="4020-56265">Kent Farm</a> in Smallville, Kansas.</p><p>Finding no answers in the Fortress, Superman discusses with Lois about adopting the boy, but she initially feels uncomfortable, but then the boy appears to talk in English. News breaks out of the young Kryptonian's disappearance. At a press conference, where Superman announces that Clark Kent and Lois Lane will take care of the Kryptonian child, Bizarro arrives and attacks him. The fight threatens the city around the conference location, and Superman finally uses super-breath to throw him away. Superman defeats Bizarro, but somewhere else Zod, Non and Ursa appear.</p><p>As the three enter the Fortress, Zod activates the A.I. and is angered by the information it holds on him.

While maintaining the most common elements of Superman origin, slight additions and changes were introduced and addressed. Instead of leaving Smallville and directly heading to Metropolis, Clark at the age of 18, headed out to travel the world working as a freelance reporter after receiving several University degree's. At the age of 25, Clark finds himself in West Africa, reporting instances of people standing up against corrupt officials and there he learns after a friend's unfortunate death, that he has a true calling to help people as an altruistic protector and defender.</p><p>When he returned home, Clark decided to create a new identity to fight "crime" and protect the world as Superman. His adopted parents, Martha and Jonathan Kent, help him meld together an entirely new version of himself, changing everything from his posture, stance, clothing, and even speech to throw off any suspicion people might have as to his alter ego. An immensely different aspect about Birthright is that instead of being instantly welcomed among the people of Metropolis, Superman became alienated and mistrusted due to the schemes of Lex Luthor. Luthor attempted to frame Superman after discovering his heritage and translating lost transmissions from Clark's Kryptonian birth parents from Krpyton. Luthor created a faux army consisting of invading "Kryptonians" whom were presented as attempting to invade, conquer and colonize Earth all in his effort to prove to the people of Metropolis, and the world, that Superman was not a savior but the first of an invasion force.</p><p>With the help of Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen, Superman broke the barrier around Metropolis which restricted his powers and stopped Luthor's army, revealing that it was indeed Luthor who was behind the entire attack. Superman then became accepted as a hero in both Metropolis and the world over. Clark then landed a job as a journalist reporting for the Daily Planet and working alongside Lois Lane.</p><h3>The New 52</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-2753654" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/145267/2753654-justice_league__1___page_26.jpg" data-ratio="1.536312849162" data-width="1074" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1074px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:153.6%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/145267/2753654-justice_league__1___page_26.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2753654"><img alt="New 52 Superman" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" data-width="416" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/145267/2753654-justice_league__1___page_26.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/145267/2753654-justice_league__1___page_26.jpg 1074w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/14/145267/2753654-justice_league__1___page_26.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/145267/2753654-justice_league__1___page_26.jpg 624w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/145267/2753654-justice_league__1___page_26.jpg 416w"><noscript><img alt="New 52 Superman" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/145267/2753654-justice_league__1___page_26.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/145267/2753654-justice_league__1___page_26.jpg 1074w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/14/145267/2753654-justice_league__1___page_26.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/145267/2753654-justice_league__1___page_26.jpg 624w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/145267/2753654-justice_league__1___page_26.jpg 416w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" data-width="416"></noscript></a><figcaption>New 52 Superman</figcaption></figure><p>In The <a href="/the-new-52/4015-56061/" data-ref-id="4015-56061">New 52</a>", DC's relaunch of it's entire comic book line, Superman is still from Krypton, was still raised on a farm in the American Mid-West, is still named Clark Kent and is still a journalist who resides in the city of Metropolis. In fact much of what has been part of Superman's mythos for decades is still true. However, there have been some changes both minor and major. In the New 52 Superman is no longer married to <a href="/lois-lane/4005-1808/" data-ref-id="4005-1808">Lois Lane</a> and he has once again been established as one of the <a href="/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/" data-ref-id="4060-31815">Justice League</a>'s founding members. Superman's costume has went through what some would consider significant changes. He no longer wears red shorts over his blue pants and his yellow belt has been replaced by a red one with just a bit of yellow as part of his super-symbol buckle. His iconic "Super-symbol" itself has been changed ever so slightly, too. It is now metallic and raised off his shirt. The shape of the "S" within the symbol has also been changed. Like the majority of the other DC superheroes during this relaunch, Superman's costume now has lines/seams all throughout it. Lastly, Superman now has a high collar which goes up his neck and sleeves which end in cuffs that extend part way down the back of his hands ending in a red border.</p><p>It was also revealed that both Jonathan and Martha Kent have already passed away due to a car accident and Clark has had to grow into the role as Superman without them. This is a stark difference to the Pre-52 and many other sources where either both parents were still alive or Martha lived on as widow.</p><h4><em>Action Comics</em></h4><p>Written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Rags Morales, Superman is introduced five years in the past before founding the Justice League. Superman is shown wearing a blue t-shirt with his family crest on it with blue jeans, boots, and his Grandfathers cape, which was given to him by his father before the death of Krypton. Superman is shown as a vigilante outlaw as he tries to fight injustice in Metropolis. Following his confrontation with tycoon <a href="/glen-glenmorgan/4005-81021/" data-ref-id="4005-81021">Glen Glenmorgan,</a> Superman is pursued by Police and then followed by the military, who had actually under the influence of Lex Luthor sabotaged an entire neighborhood of Metropolis to be a death trap. Superman is captured by the military, lead by General Lane, is tortured, and then questioned by Luthor as to who he really is.</p><p>Luthor asks him if he knows about Krypton and then shows him a skeleton of what appears to be an alien, claiming it to be one of Superman's kind. Superman laughs at this and then breaks free, escaping his room and tries to escape. While running through the halls, he comes into contact with his space ship, which actually begins to speak to him. Superman regrettably leaves the ship behind, although promising to come back, and escapes the compound. Following this it is shown that Luthor had actually been consorting with an unknown individually who had been feeding Luthor his information on Superman. The days following show Superman being seen not just as a nuisance to the police but to the people as well. They turn on him, and Superman is forced to 'retire'. However, Superman is then called into action once again when <a href="/brainiac/4005-4684/" data-ref-id="4005-4684">The Collector of All Worlds</a>, Luthor's contact, strikes the world, using the internet to take control of the technology in Metropolis to 'preserve' it. Among this technology is <a href="/metallo/4005-4689/" data-ref-id="4005-4689">John Corben</a>, who had just been fused with an experimental war suit following Superman's escape from the compound. Superman, with the help of Steel, who had helped create the war suit, is able to defeat Corben before Metropolis is shrunk by The Collector and placed in his ship, much like he did to Kandor. Superman is forced to go up to The Collector's ship and retrieve Metropolis.</p><p>Superman then is forced to battle The Collector (along with Corben who had beamed onto the ship prior). During the battle, Superman comes across Kryptonian technology, along with a DNA synchronized war suit, which he puts on to have a better chance of defeating The Collector. He is then able to 'unplug' the Collector by using his shrunken ship, which was inside the shrunken city of Metropolis, throwing it into The Collectors mainframe and shutting it down. Superman is then able put Metropolis back the way it was before the shrink was permanent and The Collectors ship became his first Fortress.</p><p>Superman's adventures then continue by jumping forward to the point after The Justice League is formed. Superman is shown to being hunted down by Nimrod, a hunter who has to his account killed everything. Nimrod tries to hunt down Superman by finding a place where he is most vulnerable, even going on to discover Superman's secret identity. However before Nimrod is able to make the kill, Clark Kent 'dies' in an explosion caused by an ex-employee of the now incarcerated Glen Glenmorgan. This then allows for Superman to catch Nimrod of off balance and the result ends with Nimrod getting put in the hospital after a battle with Superman. Following this Superman is forced to create for himself another secret identity Johnny Clark, a firefighter.</p><p>However this allows for no peace when Superman is forced to do battle with "The First Superman". This is shown to be the new-52 version of <a href="/captain-comet/4005-30559/" data-ref-id="4005-30559">Captain Comet</a>, who is also known as the Blake Farm Ghost. Going by Adam, he explains that he's there to stop the end of Earth, his home-world, by taking another "neo sapien" with him, Susie Lane, Lois Lane's niece. Adam tries to force Susie to come along with him to his spaceship, coaxing her with his stories of outer-space. However, when an alien attacks Metropolis during this time and hurts Lois Susie begs Adam to help her, which he does not. Superman then battles Adam, trying to help both Susie and Lois at the same time. He is able to defeat Adam in time and then brings Lois to the hospital where he himself operates after learning as much as he can about her condition at the library.</p><p>After this another villain is introduced to the New-52, <a href="/dr-xa-du/4005-30668/" data-ref-id="4005-30668">Xa-Du</a>. On Halloween night Superman, while working in The Fortress (his current one), is visited by Xa-Du, wearing a suit to allow him to interact with Earth while in the Phantom Zone. Xa-Du is able to trick Superman into going into the Phantom Zone and is left with the world for his to rule, or so he thinks. Inside the Zone, while being attacked by fellow Zone dwellers, is helped by <a href="/krypto/4005-8332/" data-ref-id="4005-8332">Krypto</a>, who before Krypton's destruction had jumped into the Zone, and <a href="/phantom-stranger/4005-3298/" data-ref-id="4005-3298">The Phantom Stranger</a>, who had also been tricked into the Zone. Superman is able to manipulate Xa-Du from the Zone and is able to get inside the suit and frees himself as well as Krypto later (The Stranger having already left).</p><p>The next event occurs when Superman travels to Mars to help a group of astronauts battle Metalek, an alien machine bent on recreating its home world. Superman is able to make peace with it, but not before The Multitude, a group of what appears to be parasite like angles, attack the planet. Superman deduces that based on their appearance, they are from a different dimension and can be defeated by a blast that is similar to their own dimension. Superman's plan works but not minutes after that he is attack by <a href="/vyndktvx/4005-86373/" data-ref-id="4005-86373">the little man.</a></p><p>After this attack, Superman is pulled back into reality. It's revealed that the events of Xa-Du and the Multitude have not happened yet and that they were images shown to him by his landlord Mrs. Nyxly, who is in fact a resident of the 5th dimension. She explains that her father's old court magician, Vyndktvx, has been targeting Superman because of his role with hurting him when he attacked the King-thing Brpxz and that what she's been showing him has been to show him she is telling the truth and that Vyndktvx can strike at any moment in time, all for the purpose of hurting Superman. Before Nyxly can act and help Superman, she is shot by Nimrod, and Superman is now cornered.</p><h4>Superman</h4><p>In the New 52, <a href="/morgan-edge/4005-13100/" data-ref-id="4005-13100">Morgan Edge</a>, CEO of <a href="/wgbs-employees/4060-57882/" data-ref-id="4060-57882">Galaxy Communications</a>, buys out the <a href="/daily-planet/4060-42195/" data-ref-id="4060-42195">Daily Planet</a>, setting into motion the paper going into a more modern age, now coexisting with the broadcasting company, Lois becoming the new executive producer of the networks nightly news, and the destruction of the old Daily Planet building. During the opening of the new <a href="/daily-planet/4020-55695/" data-ref-id="4020-55695">Daily Planet</a> building, Superman, while stopping a terrorist attack, is interrupted by an attack by an unknown fire based alien creature. Speaking an unknown language, the alien attacks Superman, endangering the lives of Metropolis in the process. Superman is able to defeat the creature before anyone else is hurt, including the news helicopter that was following him during the fight, by pushing the creature into space, taking away its oxygen. Days later another creature attacks, this time one that has become invisible only to Superman, giving itself an edge during the entire fight.</p><p>Thankfully though, news crews followed the attack the entire time, projecting the monster on the screens to let Superman see them. However, during the fight, the monster fades away from the cameras, leaving Superman to himself. Just as before, another monster attacks Superman in Metropolis, this time one with the powers of ice, freezing anything it uses it's powers on into ice. Superman is able to take care of the monster, this time using his heat vision directly on the reporter Heather Kelley, who seemed to be the reason behind the attack. Once the monster disappears, so does Heather. Later on that day, Heather appears beside the other two people responsible for the monsters, a guard from the Metropolis Astrodome and a homeless man from the sewers, they enter into a conversation and although the language cannot be understood, they all say Clark Kent, and Superman. Days later Heather reappears, going on TV to talk about what had happened during the attack. However, when Clark shows himself to her, she appears in the ice alien's form and teleports herself and Clark to the site of his old apartment building, where the other aliens await. Superman battles them, but with their combined powers they over take him.</p><p>During their dialogue throughout the fight the aliens repeatedly tell Superman that what they do now they were created to do, when Superman asks them who created them, they all say, "you." Following this, Superman awakens after being covered in the essence of the three aliens, leaving their human hosts unconscious. Superman gives the bodies to the paramedics for attention, and then goes out to 'save the city'. However, the behavior that Superman exempts following does not appear like him. He begins to kill all of his past enemies, including parts from a robot, the gorilla Titano, and the Sky Raiders. People around Metropolis have no idea what is going on with their hero and it all comes to a climax after Superman attacks the reporter William McCoy, a reporter who has throughout that time been bashing Superman and his motives. Lois, who is in such a great despair over what Superman is doing, tries to call Clark, who has been missing for days now. Her yells, which Clark is able to hear, awaken him from some sort of sleep outside in space just as Superman throws McCoy over the Daily Planet building.</p><p>Its revealed that the one that has been posing as Superman during those few days was actually a bug like alien machine, which five years ago had clung to Superman's suit during the Collector's attack. It's some type of alien nanite, one that had once connected its home planet in a symbiotic partnership. After its release from the Collector, it began to take note of Superman's powers, such as he's heat vision, he's optic and auditory powers, and his ice breath. After it threw McCoy off of the Daily Planet, Supergirl came in and rescued him, soon followed by the real Superman. Not allowing for Metropolis to be a battlefield, Superman takes the imposter to the arctic, where he finally puts an end to its menace.</p><p>The next story line deals with broadening Superman's rogues gallery. <a href="/helspont/4005-40632/" data-ref-id="4005-40632">Helspont</a>, after escaping from Stormwatch HQ, takes up base in a Daemonite outpost on Earth, sending his robotic minions to challenge Superman, hoping that doing so would lead the Kryptonian to him, which it does. Battling the robot, Superman is teleported away to the outpost, meeting the Daemonite for the first time. Helspont tries to talk to Superman, however because of Superman's almost impatience tone with the alien, Helspont knocks him out, placing Superman into a dream like state, showing him the apparent future Superman will face, one where Earth has turned against him. Helspont explains to Superman that he wants him to join him in retaining his home world and reestablish the Daemonite empire to its once glory, in return, Helspont would leave Earth under Superman's domain. Superman, over course, refuses, and attacks Helspont, however during the battle he discovers that the alien is more than a match for him, and tries to go for a new approach. Superman destroys the Daemonite outpost, leaving Helspont without a home or armory. However, once Superman turns once again to take on the Daemonite, he's disappeared.</p><p>The next story follows Superman going against the metahuman Anguish, a woman possessing the powers of both super-strength and intangibility, making her impossible to touch. Following rescuing a Russian sub from getting stuck inside the ocean, Superman returns to Metropolis to find Anguish breaking into a safe deposit box at a bank, claiming to own the contents inside. During the fight that follows, inside the Daily Planet a new story is being broken after blogger Victor Barnes gives proof to Superman's secret identity, however it being false. Whichever the way, Barnes goes all the way to the top with his story after getting pushed off by Lois Lane.</p><p>Giving it to Morgan Edge, Edge approves it, and green lights the story, airing it just when the battle starts to close. During the battle, Anguish, while still not hurt, drops the locket that she had obtained from the box and it ends up getting crushed, which angers her deeply. Thanks to the story of Superman's secret identity, Anguish leaves the fights and tracks down the man that has been said to be Superman and his family, looking to take care of a little revenge for the destruction of the locket. Thankfully though, Superman is able to stop her from hurting anyone, calming her down enough to stop the fight and pose in front of the camera with the man people claimed to be him, destroying the proof of Barnes' story. Superman then gives Anguish back her locket, fixing it for her, she thanks him for this, and then disappears into the rain.</p><p>Following the story of the sub Superman had saved, Superman investigates exactly why it was down in the ocean anyway. Finding his way to a science station in Russia, he discovers the remains of butchered scientists and a metal capsule containing organic material inside. Allying himself with Russian 'security', and finds where the killer went, a small town next to a nuclear reactor. Superman follows the trail, finding that the people of the town are all but dead. The creature inside the pod attacks, showing itself to be faster than Superman, actually knocking several blows on him before capturing him with its equipment. Following this, Superman wakes up inside a cocoon like substance that the alien trapped him inside.</p><p>Superman is able to break free and attacks the alien, tearing off its mask, which had allowed it to breathe. Superman gives it back and the alien explains that the Russians had captured him and had wanted him to be their own Superman, of which it had no desire to be. The alien attacks once again, using a portal it opened up to allow for an alien of its home world to come through and subdue him. However, Superman is able to take out the creature just in time to escape a war head fired at the base by the Russians. The alien, of course, is not seen again.</p><p>Once again, Helspont appears, this time with an entire army to back him up in his self powered ship. Superman confronts Helspont just as his followers attack the heroes of Earth, trying to win them over to their cause, but to know avail. Helspont tells Superman that centuries ago he had traveled to Earth with his army and had personally seen to the creation of the metagene, hoping that as it grew it would raise a greater army for himself, leaving Superman with this knowledge and the job to make sure that he still tends to his 'fields'. Once he's left, Superman doesn't know what to do next.</p><h3><a href="/hel-on-earth/4045-56937/" data-ref-id="4045-56937"><em>H'el on Earth</em></a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-3243266" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114723/3243266-9576777877-SUPER.jpg" data-ratio="1.536" data-width="500" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 500px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:153.6%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114723/3243266-9576777877-SUPER.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-3243266"><img alt="Superman vs H'el" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" data-width="416" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111114723/3243266-9576777877-SUPER.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114723/3243266-9576777877-SUPER.jpg 500w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111114723/3243266-9576777877-SUPER.jpg 416w"><noscript><img alt="Superman vs H'el" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111114723/3243266-9576777877-SUPER.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114723/3243266-9576777877-SUPER.jpg 500w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111114723/3243266-9576777877-SUPER.jpg 416w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" data-width="416"></noscript></a><figcaption>Superman vs H'el</figcaption></figure><p>After his fight with <a href="/helspont/4005-40632/" data-ref-id="4005-40632">Helspont</a>, Superman asks Dr. <a href="/shay-veritas/4005-86243/" data-ref-id="4005-86243">Shay Veritas</a> for help in making a training regime to increase his power in case Helspont returns. After a few weeks of exercises in the Block, Dr. Veritas' scientific complex, Superman returns to Metropolis, knowing that he has ignored his life as Clark Kent. At the Daily Planet, Clark finds out that Lois is planning to move out with her boyfriend. He also grows dissatisfied with his work, knowing that <a href="//www.comicvine.com/morgan-edge/4005-13100/" data-ref-id="4005-13100">Morgan Edge</a> is manipulating the Daily Planet's articles, so he quits the Daily Planet. Later, Superman discovers a mysterious alien dragon attacking Metropolis. After a lengthy brawl that leads to Ireland, Superman kills the dragon in an explosion. But in that moment, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/supergirl/4005-2351/" data-ref-id="4005-2351">Supergirl</a> appears to Superman, telling him that the creature he killed was a Kryptonian animal. She says that if a Kryptonian animal is on Earth, then that means Krypton must still be alive.</p><p>Later, Lois visits Clark at his apartment, where they talk about Clark's recent departure from the Daily Planet and Lois' moving with Jonathan. In that moment, Clark receives a visit from Supergirl. To avoid an awkward moment, Clark gets Lois out of the apartment. Later, Superman and Supergirl go to the Metropolis Centennial Park. Supergirl reveals he has found another Kryptonian, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/hel/4005-86102/" data-ref-id="4005-86102">H'el</a>, who introduces himself to Superman. H'el expresses his plan to save Krypton and shows Superman the unconscious body of his clone, Superboy. H'el tries to kill Superboy, but Superman stops him, and the two engage in a fight. Superboy and Supergirl attempt to intervene, but H'el brutally knocks them out. After briefly paralyzing Superman with a vision of his failure to protect the Suicide Slums three years ago, H'el leaves Metropolis, but not before stating that he will save Krypton with Kara's help, no matter what price Earth has to pay.</p><p>Superman brings the wounded <a href="//www.comicvine.com/superboy/4005-1686/" data-ref-id="4005-1686">Superboy</a> to the <a href="//www.comicvine.com/fortress-of-solitude/4020-41185/" data-ref-id="4020-41185">Fortress of Solitude</a> in order to help him recover from his injuries. With the help of <a href="//www.comicvine.com/cyborg/4005-2388/" data-ref-id="4005-2388">Cyborg</a> and Dr. Veritas, Superman devises a way to cure Superboy. Detaching his Kryptonian armor, Superman places it on Superboy. Both realize that the armor is the only thing keeping Superboy alive, as H’el caused serious damage to Superboy’s cellular structure. Suddenly, H'el appears and kicks Superman and Superboy out of the Fortress.</p><p>After being expelled from the Fortress, Superman tells Superboy that they will need help in recovering it. They travel to a special prison designed to hold only one person: <a href="//www.comicvine.com/lex-luthor/4005-41952/" data-ref-id="4005-41952">Lex Luthor</a>. There, Superman questions Luthor about H'el's plans. Superman believes that H'el wants to go back in time to prevent Krypton's destruction, and Luthor says that it can be done, but to do so, H'el will create an explosion that will destroy the entire solar system. To stop H'el, Superman calls the Justice League and prepares to attack the Fortress.</p><p>In the Block, Superman and his allies formulate a plan to stop H'el. Given that H'el has powers beyond Superman's, the Man of Steel that a shard of <a href="//www.comicvine.com/kryptonite/4055-32213/" data-ref-id="4055-32213">Kryptonite</a> hidden in the Fortress might give the Justice League an advantage. When the team assaults the Fortress, however, H'el has already taken the shard to power the machine he is building to facilitate his journey through time. H'el also activates an alien device that traps Superman into perpetual pocket dimensions. Superboy goes into one of the device's portals in order to save him.</p><p>After a journey through several bizarre dimensions, Superman and Superboy return to the Fortress and reunite withe Justice League continue the attack. Eventually, Superman and Superboy reach H'el and Supergirl (who had decided to help H'el complete his plan), but H'el moves the Fortress someplace else, leaving the heroes in the outside. Suddenly, H'el activates his machine, unleashing a large golden beam into the sky.</p><p>H'el's star-chamber begins draining the Sun's energy. Superman, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/superboy/4005-1686/" data-ref-id="4005-1686">Superboy</a> and <a href="//www.comicvine.com/wonder-woman/4005-2048/" data-ref-id="4005-2048">Wonder Woman</a> rally to destroy the machine, but H'el attacks them, ripping the Kryptonian armor off Superboy and reattaching it to Superman, saying that if Superman is going to die, he should with his Kryptonian honor intact. Superman clashes with H'el, telling Wonder Woman to help Superboy destroy the star chamber.</p><p>Superman takes a hit from H'el and is launched into outer space. There, he meets the mysterious <a href="//www.comicvine.com/oracle/4005-87347/" data-ref-id="4005-87347">Oracle</a>, who fills Superman's mind with memories of <a href="//www.comicvine.com/krypton/4020-30670/" data-ref-id="4020-30670">Krypton</a>. When Superman attempts to talk to the Oracle, the Oracle simply disappears. Superman returns to Earth to stop H'El. Although Superboy destroys the star chamber, H'el already has enough solar energy to power his ship and travel to the past. However, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/supergirl/4005-2351/" data-ref-id="4005-2351">Supergirl</a> (who had discovered the true extent of H'el's plan) stabs H'el with a Kryptonite shard. Poisoned by the shard, H'el disappears into a time portal. With the crisis over, Superman takes Supergirl to the Fortress so he can cure her Kryptonite poisoning.</p><p>After the battle with H'el, Superman was called to a U.S. Senate hearing to discuss the existence of the <a href="//www.comicvine.com/fortress-of-solitude/4020-41185/" data-ref-id="4020-41185">Fortress of Solitude</a>. The Senate representatives want to investigate the Fortress in order to secure or remove anything that might be considered a threat to the world. However, Superman refuses, appealing to his right to privacy and the fact that the Fortress contains technology beyond humanity's control. Clark also becomes a blogger to make ends meet.</p><h3>Psi-War</h3><p>Later, Superman is attacked by the <a href="//www.comicvine.com/new-gods/4060-40647/" data-ref-id="4060-40647">New God</a> <a href="//www.comicvine.com/orion/4005-2363/" data-ref-id="4005-2363">Orion</a>, who believes him to be a threat to the universe. Fortunately, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/wonder-woman/4005-2048/" data-ref-id="4005-2048">Wonder Woman</a> stops the confrontation and discovers the reason behind Orion's attack. <a href="//www.comicvine.com/hector-hammond/4005-10210/" data-ref-id="4005-10210">Hector Hammond</a>, after falling into a coma, used his telepathy to hide his consciousness within Superman's memories. Wonder Woman and Orion banish Hammond back to his own body and Orion departs, apologizing for his earlier attack. He also uses his <a href="//www.comicvine.com/mother-box/4055-41473/" data-ref-id="4055-41473">Mother Box</a> to grant Superman protection from telepathic assaults.</p><p>Continuing his investigative work, Clark goes to <a href="//www.comicvine.com/gotham-city/4020-23611/" data-ref-id="4020-23611">Gotham City</a>, where a mysterious Chinese woman gives him a folder containing info about an urban myth called "The Twenty".

During this series of events, Superman discovers Lois has fallen into a coma and brings her to the hospital.</p><p>Later, Clark tells <a href="//www.comicvine.com/cat-grant/4005-8346/" data-ref-id="4005-8346">Cat Grant</a> about his findings on the Twenty, believing that a story that big could help bring Clark Catropolis on the map. An earthquake hits Metropolis and Superman discovers the destruction is being caused by metallic tentacles derived from <a href="//www.comicvine.com/brainiac/4005-4684/" data-ref-id="4005-4684">Brainiac</a>'s technology. Before Superman can do anything, however, he is incapacitated by a psychic attack caused by the <a href="//www.comicvine.com/h-i-v-e-queen/4005-90512/" data-ref-id="4005-90512">H.I.V.E. Queen</a>, one of the Twenty.</p><p>Recovering from the psychic attack, Superman attempts to stop the Queen, but she has the upper hand. In that moment, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/hector-hammond/4005-10210/" data-ref-id="4005-10210">Hector Hammond</a> enters the fray and engages the Queen in a mental struggle, using the people of Metropolis as soldiers.

Upon arriving, he finds the building in ruins. Superman finds the heavily injured Hammond, who says that the Queen is dead. In that moment, a new villain arrives: the <a href="//www.comicvine.com/psycho-pirate/4005-25495/" data-ref-id="4005-25495">Psycho-Pirate</a>, a telepathic who knows about Superman’s secret identity.</p><p>The Psycho Pirate leads Superman to the Swarm, a prison for psionic people, explaining that he is also one of the Twenty. The Queen created the Swarm in order to prepare the world for Brainiac's return. With the Queen dead, the Psycho Pirate wants to release the people trapped in the Swarm, so he traps Superman in an illusionary world in order to absorb his energy.</p><p>Lois, having developed psychic powers of her own, frees Superman from the illusions. Knowing they are outmatched against the Psycho Pirate, Superman and Lois join forces with Hammond and the H.I.V.E. Queen, who barely survived the Pirate's attack. They work together and defeat the Pirate, with Superman destroying his <a href="//www.comicvine.com/medusa-mask/4055-46530/" data-ref-id="4055-46530">Medusa Mask</a> with his heat vision. During the battle, however, Lois learns of Superman's secret identity and falls back into a coma. Afterwards, Superman brings Lois' comatose body back to the hospital, but then, a mysterious force pulls him into outer space.</p><h3><a href="/krypton-returns/4045-57447/" data-ref-id="4045-57447"><em>Krypton Returns</em></a></h3><p>As he travels in outer space, Superman meets up with <a href="//www.comicvine.com/superboy/4005-1686/" data-ref-id="4005-1686">Superboy</a> and <a href="//www.comicvine.com/supergirl/4005-2351/" data-ref-id="4005-2351">Supergirl</a>. The three meet the <a href="//www.comicvine.com/oracle/4005-87347/" data-ref-id="4005-87347">Oracle</a>, who explains them that H'el, who survived their earlier encounter, has managed to bring <a href="//www.comicvine.com/krypton/4020-30670/" data-ref-id="4020-30670">Krypton</a> back to life. However, H'el also altered the timeline and they must stop him from destroying the universe.

She also detects yellow sun radiation in his body and says he should wait for <a href="/jor-el/4005-9561/" data-ref-id="4005-9561">Jor-El</a>. Superman watches Lara tell Jor-El that she is pregnant, but then his armor changes back to its usual colors. In that moment, Superman confronts a mysterious person who is aware about his travel in time.</p><p>This stranger is in fact Jor-El, who came from one of the alternate futures created by H'el. Realizing he was the one who created H'el, Jor-El has come to the past to stop H'el from conquering Krypton. Superman and Jor-El travel to Krypton's core and fight H'el. At first, Jor-el wants to kill H'el but Superman instead uses H'el's own chronal powers against him and freezes him with his super-breath, locking H'el in a state of eternal limbo. As Superman and Supergirl are reunited in the present, the Oracle informs them that Superboy sacrificed his life to stop H'el. Mourning the loss of their friend, Superman and Supergirl return to Earth.</p><h3><a href="/action-comics-25-zero-year-stormbreaker-lunch-brea/4000-432292/" data-ref-id="4000-432292"><em>Destroy All Monsters</em></a></h3><p>Later, Clark hears a sound coming from <a href="//www.comicvine.com/venezuela/4020-55954/" data-ref-id="4020-55954">Venezuela</a>.

Batman acquires the box in the fight, but is attacked by Superman, who feels if he dies, Wonder Woman would become attracted to him. Wonder Woman, hoping to stop Superman from attacking Batman, hits him, causing Batman be knocked back and lose the box. With the box dormant, Wonder Woman sees that Superman is still sick, and wonders why the box is physically affecting him and not others.

Atom then tells everyone that she put it there and was the mole. In Kahndaq, she traveled into his brain and planted the Kryptonite, which hit a nerve and triggered his heat vision attack on Dr. Light. In that moment, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/the-outsider/4005-77725/" data-ref-id="4005-77725">The Outsider</a> grabs the box and opens a portal to his universe, allowing the <a href="//www.comicvine.com/crime-syndicate-of-america/4060-41531/" data-ref-id="4060-41531">Crime Syndicate of America</a> to enter the Justice League's world.</p><h3><a href="/forever-evil/4045-57223/" data-ref-id="4045-57223"><em>Forever Evil</em></a></h3><p>The Crime Syndicate imprisons the Justice Leagues inside the Firestorm Matrix, which psychologically places them in situations that depict their greatest failures. Superman is placed in a situation in which he attempts to stop Doctor Light's accidental murder over and over again. <a href="//www.comicvine.com/martian-manhunter/4005-2047/" data-ref-id="4005-2047">Martian Manhunter</a> attempts to break him out but Superman ignores him. Eventually, Superman and the rest of the Justice League members are freed when Batman successfully uses Wonder Woman's lasso to pull everyone out of the Firestorm matrix. Although he is shown to still be severely weakened to the point of near death by the Kryptonite piece still left in his brain by Atomika. His life is saved by none other than Lex Luthor who manages to remove the piece of Kryptonite from his brain.</p><h3><a href="/superman-doomed/4045-57798/" data-ref-id="4045-57798"><em>Superman: Doomed</em></a></h3><p>Set in the post-Forever Evil world, Doomsday has returned and is hellbent on destruction-already leaving behind a massive path of annihilation. Doomsday is stated to have finally reached its mature form and the Doomsday Superman had known about before was merely just in its larva form and is now more powerful than he is ever been. Superman alone is the one that stands the best chance of defeating Doomsday, let alone survive fighting against it if only for a few minutes. Lex Luthor (now working with the Justice League after the events of Forever Evil) states that Doomsday has come specifically for Superman and the only way to get Doomsday to leave if Superman were to leave as well. Clark reiterates to Batman that he believes Luthor is correct but after reassurance from both Batman and Wonder Woman, Superman heads straight for Doomsday and begins battle. After a massive battle, that pushes the Man of Steel to his limits, Superman is able to defeat Doomsday but he is then seen immediately collapsing after being infected with the Doomsday virus. The virus has caused Superman to become more angry and more prone to violent outbursts. Many of Clark's friends have begun to notice that he is acting very strangely and uncharacteristically. It is then revealed that the Doomsday virus that Superman had contracted from the fight has begun morphing him into a Doomsday like creature. With the help of Batman and Wonder Woman he attempts to fight off the Doomsday virus from taking over.</p><p>Superman is then kept in a prison built by Lex Luthor where the Justice League attempt to quickly find a cure to Superman's condition but are so far unsuccessful in doing so due to the constant presence of Doomsday particles that have the capability of draining life force. Lois comes to visit Superman and he tells her to write to the world that he might never be trusted ever again. Superman then envisions the Teen Titans in danger and breaks out of the prison to help them, he proceeds to easily crush the enemy they were fighting. The Titans, however, realize that there is something wrong with Superman and attempt to keep there distance from him. Superman flies off saying stating that it's not that there isn't something wrong with him, it's that everything is wrong with him.</p><p>Superman begins to turn more and more into a Doomsday like creature and his horrified by what is happening. Superman flies to the Atacama desert in Chile, where Steel finds him and tries to help him. Superman tells him that his mere presence his killing everything around him, even the insects, protozoa, and microbes around him. Steel tells Superman that they can help him, but Superman instead gives him a controller for the phantom zone projector and asks Steel to send him through it should things go wrong. The two shake hands, but Superman suddenly crushes it. Senator Lane sends in both the Atomic Skull and a revived Metallo in to stop Superman, at the protest of Steel who takes down the Atomic Skull. Superman is left to deal with Metallo whom Superman realizes is strapped with Kryptonite bombs, which if detonated, would kill both of them. Superman pleads with him to stop telling him that he will die but Metallo detonates the bombs anyway and kills himself, Superman survives the blast and is left transformed even more into a Doomsday-like creature. The bomb merely weakened the part of Superman that was actually Superman and all that's left is the the Doom part of him.</p><p>Wonder Woman attempts to get the help of Hessia to try and heal Superman but Hessia instead attacks him and states that the only way to protect the world is to kill him. Wonder Woman lifts Superman out of the radius of the Kryptonite bomb and reverts back to his normal state. He tells Wonder Woman that he must leave to find a place where he can't hurt anyone. However, he is suddenly attacked by a group of Red Lanterns consisting of Guy Gardner, Zox, and Supergirl who attempt to stop him. The three are knocked back down to Earth where Wonder Woman tells them that if they cannot beat him, and if they cannot help him, they should just leave him alone.</p><h2>Personal Data</h2><h3>Characteristics</h3><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 6'3" (193cm)</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 235 lbs.

While some heroes wear masks or hoods or are physically changed when they don their superhero identity, Superman does nothing of the kind. He presents his smiling face in broad daylight. So how does he get away with having a secret identity when he appears to have nothing to hide?</p><p>It all starts with that fact, exactly. Wearing no mask, he appears to have nothing to hide. Why would a being too grand and powerful as Superman live a normal daily life among the people he protects? In short, the general public believes Superman to simply be a strange being from another planet, no more. He has no secret identity to protect and lives as Superman all the time of every day.</p><p>He does add another layer however. We as readers understand that Clark Kent becomes Superman in his heroic exploits, but the Clark Kent that he allows the world to see is an elaborate act. He creates a character so bumbling and oafish that the very last thought anybody would ever have about him is that he is the all-powerful, ever perfect Superman.</p><p>While many misunderstand Kent's glasses as the entirety of his disguise, they are in fact just icing on the cake. While he is Clark Kent, in public, he wears his glasses, stutters, raises his voice an octave and slouches, drawing attention to several personal details that would detract from thoughts of anything "super."</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3>Solar Battery</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-2145866" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2145866-absolute_all_star_superman_frank_quitel.jpg" data-ratio="1.5044444444444" data-width="900" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 900px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:150.4%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2145866-absolute_all_star_superman_frank_quitel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2145866"><img alt="Superman displaying his power" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" data-width="425" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101435/2145866-absolute_all_star_superman_frank_quitel.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2145866-absolute_all_star_superman_frank_quitel.jpg 900w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/101435/2145866-absolute_all_star_superman_frank_quitel.jpg 638w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101435/2145866-absolute_all_star_superman_frank_quitel.jpg 425w"><noscript><img alt="Superman displaying his power" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101435/2145866-absolute_all_star_superman_frank_quitel.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2145866-absolute_all_star_superman_frank_quitel.jpg 900w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/101435/2145866-absolute_all_star_superman_frank_quitel.jpg 638w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101435/2145866-absolute_all_star_superman_frank_quitel.jpg 425w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" data-width="425"></noscript></a><figcaption>Superman displaying his power</figcaption></figure><p>As a Kryptonian, Kal-El possesses the ability to absorb the solar energy from yellow stars. His Kryptonian body is constantly absorbing and storing energy from Earth's yellow sun (allowing him to retain energy under roofed structures and even at night) which in turn grants him incredible powers, including superhuman strength, enhanced senses, impenetrable skin, and the ability to defy gravity.</p><p>His body is also able to absorb the energy of a blue sun, which also grants him increased strength and various other powers (although not to the same degree as under a yellow sun). Superman has also demonstrated the ability to absorb certain other forms of energy, such as the anti-sunlight of Mageddon.</p><h3>Super-Strength</h3><p>Superman has the ability to physically lift impossibly massive amounts of weight. Superman's strength easily surpasses the Class 100 strength level (this is the ability to lift over 100 tons under normal conditions) which is the ability to lift in excess of 100 tons with absolutely no effort at all, and has no known limit. Superman's strength is aided in lifting/supporting the most massive objects--especially when flying--by the bio-electric force field his body produces.</p><p>His strength is usually portrayed the same way as most other characters in the Class 100 tier, but his high-end showings indicate his might may be well in excess of planetary levels. While the limits of Superman's strength vary from writer to writer, he is commonly considered in-universe to be one of the most powerful beings on Earth, with some even considering him to be the most powerful.</p><h3>Super-Speed</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-2145849" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2145849-flashrebirth3.jpg" data-ratio="1.5" data-width="400" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 400px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:150.0%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2145849-flashrebirth3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2145849"><img alt="Superman racing the Flash" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" data-width="426" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2145849-flashrebirth3.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2145849-flashrebirth3.jpg 400w"><noscript><img alt="Superman racing the Flash" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2145849-flashrebirth3.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2145849-flashrebirth3.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" data-width="426"></noscript></a><figcaption>Superman racing the Flash</figcaption></figure><p>Superman has the ability to move and fly incredibly fast. He possesses the ability to achieve speeds faster than light, although this is usually only seen in the vacuum of space as he is known to limit his velocity on Earth to prevent environmental damage. The upper limits of his speed are not quantified, but he is usually considered to be slower than the Flash.</p><p>Superman is also capable of combining speed with dexterity to pull off complicated tasks in a short time frame. In battle, he can move so fast his opponents seem much slower relative to him, creating time to avoid attacks and plan his next action. He can also move his limbs at incredible speeds, allowing him to dish out dozens of strikes in a second or less, in a manner similar to the Flash. Superman's mind is similarly accelerated; he can process and understand vast amounts of information nearly instantly.</p><h3>Vision/Optic Powers</h3><p>Kal-El is able to see over great distances and perceive even the smallest of objects. This vision also allows him to see through the atomic structure of an object, though he is unable to see through lead.</p><p>Superman’s physiology can convert stored solar energy into beams of highly concentrated thermal energy which can reach temperatures comparable to those produced by stars. The two beams of energy which are released from his eyes are bright red in color, but at lower temperatures can be made invisible, allowing him to work undetected.</p><h3>Super Hearing</h3><p>Kal-El has the super human ability to hear all sounds at any volume or pitch and across any distance, presumably as long as there is atmosphere to carry the sonic vibrations.</p><h3>Super Stamina</h3><p>Superman’s Kryptonian physiology allows him exert himself to peak capacity for an undetermined amount of time. When under the light of a yellow star, he is constantly replenishing his solar reserves. In an environment without the light of a yellow star, his solar reserves are gradually expended as he exerts himself.</p><h3>Invulnerability</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-2186788" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2186788-superman_alex_ross.jpg" data-ratio="1.2653778558875" data-width="569" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 569px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:126.5%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2186788-superman_alex_ross.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2186788"><img alt="Bulletproof" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" data-width="505" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101435/2186788-superman_alex_ross.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2186788-superman_alex_ross.jpg 569w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/101435/2186788-superman_alex_ross.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101435/2186788-superman_alex_ross.jpg 505w"><noscript><img alt="Bulletproof" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101435/2186788-superman_alex_ross.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2186788-superman_alex_ross.jpg 569w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/101435/2186788-superman_alex_ross.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101435/2186788-superman_alex_ross.jpg 505w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" data-width="505"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bulletproof</figcaption></figure><p>Superman possesses an immense degree of personal invulnerability, and is able to easily withstand bullets, missiles, bombs and other weapons without a scratch. Those without superhuman strength are more likely to hurt themselves than him by punching Superman, and even most characters who possess superhuman strength are not able to hurt him enough to take him down. Destructive power on a cosmic scale may knock him out, but he has survived such attacks and recovered from them.</p><p>Although hurting Superman with simple physical force is not an easy task, characters with sufficient superhuman strength of their own, such as Mongul, Darkseid, Doomsday and Despero, among others, are able to do so. Powerful energy attacks are also capable of hurting Superman.</p><h3><b>Flight</b></h3><p>While Superman's body is charged with solar energy he is able to emit a gravitational field that enables him to defy gravity. Kal-El has extreme mobility while he is in flight allowing him to fight, change course, and also carry great weights. While in Earth's atmosphere Kal-El is able to move at supersonic speed; while in space, he can move at superluminal speeds. Kal-El tends to avoid moving at superluminal speeds while in a planet’s atmosphere so that he does not harm the area around him.</p><h3><b>Super Breath /</b> <b>Freeze Breath</b></h3><p>Kal-El has the ability to suck in a large amount of air into his lungs and either hold it within him for a long period of time or create strong forces of wind with it. He is able to control the temperature with which he expels this power.</p><h3><b>Longevity</b></h3><p>In some interpretations, yellow sun-powered Kryptonians have been shown to live almost indefinitely.</p><h3><b>Total Recall</b></h3><p>Kal-El has the ability to instantly recall events that he pays specific attention to or that hold great emotional significance to him. When he has absorbed solar energy he has the ability to solve problems with superhuman speed.</p><h3><b>Combat Experience</b></h3><p>Superman is shown to have knowledge in hand to hand combat, the most basic being Boxing and Wrestling.</p><p>In Pre-Crisis, Superman knew a Kryptonian martial art called Klurkor, which he taught Lois Lane. Post Crisis, Superman was trained in Torquasm-Rao and Torquasm-Vo, 2 styles of Kryptonian Martial arts. Rao is more physical and offensive, while Vo is more meditative, fluid, and spiritual (the latter can produce a psychic or astral projection aspect, which Superman used to fight the Eradicator and psychic entities like Dominus).</p><p>He also displays a knowledge of pressure points, which even dates back to his Golden Age appearance, he claims he was taught this technique by Earth's greatest expert (possibly Batman). It is unknown if he still possesses these skills in the New 52 but Captain Comet has said that Superman's brawling skills are formidable.</p><h3>Genius Level Intellect/Leadership</h3><p>Superman is highly intelligent, with a natural IQ higher than humans. He's able to analyze and solve problems in top speed, due to his super speed. He has shown to be able to reprogram machines and apply science to his fighting. Superman has invented a few things from time to time and has solid knowledge on Kryptonian and Earth technology alike. He is also a fantastic journalist and writer, stated to be second best in the Daily Planet, first being <a href="//www.comicvine.com/lois-lane/4005-1808/" data-ref-id="4005-1808">Lois Lane</a>.</p><p>Superman is also a strong leader. He serves as a symbol of hope to both superhumans and the common civilian. He sometimes uses a Kryptonian technique called "Torquasm Vo," which focuses his mental discipline in tough situations. It has sometimes been used to manipulated the minds of others. The technique of Torquasm Rao allows Superman to separate himself from his physical body, giving him the ability to fight on the astral plane and resist mental attacks.</p><h2>Weaknesses</h2><h3><a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/magic/4015-55759/" data-ref-id="4015-55759"><b>Magic</b></a></h3><p>Superman is still a mortal and is, as such, still as vulnerable to the workings of magic, in all its forms, as anyone else. <a href="/wonder-woman/4005-2048/" data-ref-id="4005-2048">Wonder Woman</a>'s <a href="/wonder-womans-tiara/4055-51489/" data-ref-id="4055-51489">Tiara</a> is magical and can therefore be used to injure Superman, for he is susceptible to magic.</p><p>In the New 52 (<em><a href="//www.comicvine.com/action-comics-23-atomic-knights-part-two-the-world/4000-420609/" data-ref-id="4000-420609">Action Comics #23</a></em>), it is said that "magic is something that often counters Superman's natural abilities" and that "spells often trump the difference between red and yellow suns that are the source of his powers".</p><h3><b>Kryptonite</b></h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-203715" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/203715-188412-kryptonite.jpg" data-ratio="1.1618705035971" data-width="278" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 278px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:116.2%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/203715-188412-kryptonite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-203715"><img alt="A chunk of Kryptonite" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px" data-width="278" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/203715-188412-kryptonite.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/203715-188412-kryptonite.jpg 278w"><noscript><img alt="A chunk of Kryptonite" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/203715-188412-kryptonite.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/203715-188412-kryptonite.jpg 278w" sizes="(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px" data-width="278"></noscript></a><figcaption>A chunk of Kryptonite</figcaption></figure><p>When Krypton exploded, its fragments crossed through a radiation belt that irradiated them, making the rocks extremely toxic to anyone with Kryptonian physiology, but mostly harmless to anyone else. The mineral causes Superman to lose his powers and experience extraordinary pain and eventually death. If from suffering <a href="/kryptonite/4055-32213/" data-ref-id="4055-32213">Kryptonite</a> poisoning, he can recover if he gets away from the Kryptonite and exposes himself to yellow sun radiation, thus fueling his healing factor. Kryptonite has been known to cause harm such as cancer to humans after prolonged exposure to its radiation. (Most notably, Lex Luthor who had to have his hand amputated after wearing a <a href="/kryptonite-ring/4055-56452/" data-ref-id="4055-56452">Kryptonite Ring</a> for an extended period of time during John Byrne's retconning of Superman after <em>Crisis of the Infinite Earths</em>.) There are several types of Kryptonite and all have different effects on him.</p><p>In New 52 appearances, the Kryptonite is again referred to as being rare, is shown that can be used as an energy source . The mineral doesn't take away the Superman's powers, but is able to decrease it . It is unknown if has effects on humans.</p><h3><b>Physical Exertion</b></h3><p>In his Pre-52 appearances, there have been instances when Superman has had to physically exert himself for extended periods of time. Due to this, his body has little time to rest and recover and thus fails to absorb a sufficient amount of solar energy to continuously power his body. The best example of this was when Superman fought Doomsday which lead to his death.</p><p>It is unknown if this still affects Superman in the New 52, but as of yet, Superman has never been forced to physically exert himself and considering his powers still stem from solar absorption, it's safe to assume that it's still possible.</p><h3><b>Lead</b></h3><p>Superman cannot see through lead thus blocking all of his vision powers. Lead is also known to protect Superman from Kryponite radiation.</p><h3><b>Red Sun Radiation</b></h3><p>Superman is weakened when exposed to red solar energy similar to that of his home planet's sun, Rao. Superman will lose his Kryptonian abilities when exposed to red sun energy and must be recharged by yellow sun energy in order to regain them.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>Earth-1 Superman</h3><p>This version of Superman appears in the Superman: Earth One graphic novel that was released with Volume 1 in 2010. This version of Superman appears to much younger as he stated to be only 20 years old and the comic seems to be more grounded and portray Superman in a slightly more realistic and modern environment that is free from the mainstream DC Universe continuity in order to introduce the character to potentially new readers.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-3845245" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11113/111139730/3845245-9260128125-se1-s.jpg" data-ratio="1.60390625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:160.4%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11113/111139730/3845245-9260128125-se1-s.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-3845245"><img alt="Superman as he appears in Earth-1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" data-width="399" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11113/111139730/3845245-9260128125-se1-s.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11113/111139730/3845245-9260128125-se1-s.jpg 1280w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11113/111139730/3845245-9260128125-se1-s.jpg 1197w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11113/111139730/3845245-9260128125-se1-s.jpg 598w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11113/111139730/3845245-9260128125-se1-s.jpg 399w"><noscript><img alt="Superman as he appears in Earth-1" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11113/111139730/3845245-9260128125-se1-s.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11113/111139730/3845245-9260128125-se1-s.jpg 1280w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11113/111139730/3845245-9260128125-se1-s.jpg 1197w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11113/111139730/3845245-9260128125-se1-s.jpg 598w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11113/111139730/3845245-9260128125-se1-s.jpg 399w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" data-width="399"></noscript></a><figcaption>Superman as he appears in Earth-1</figcaption></figure><h3>Earth-2 Superman</h3><p>Previous to Crisis on Infinite Earths, <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/earth-2/4015-56462/" data-ref-id="4015-56462"><strong>Earth-2</strong></a> was designated as the Earth on which all the stories for which the Justice Society of America occurred.

Instead of being raised to fight for "Truth, Justice, and the American Way", Kal-El fights for Stalin and for Socialism. He is referred to as the Champion of the common folk. During the arms race between U.S.A. and and the Soviet Union during the 1950's, Superman is revealed to the world as the Soviet secret weapon who is destined to turn the tide.</p><p>The American government in fear, hires Lex Luthor to destroy Superman. As in classic fashion, Superman and Lex become mortal enemies and after each failed attempt at defeating Superman, Luthor grows more and more tiresome of the "invader". After Stalin's death by the work of cyanide poisoning, Superman refuses to take his place and instead vows to bring peace to not only the Soviet Union, but to the rest of the world as well.</p><p>Within years, Superman expands the Soviet Union into most parts of the world calling it the "Global Soviet Union". The only places remained untouched are those belonging the the United States of America. Superman began to instil "mind control devices" onto subjects who would misbehave and the world began to take action. After shrinking Moscow and being unable to repair the damages, Superman takes full responsibility for the actions of Brainiac and Luthor. Brainiac reveals that he was never under Superman's control. Superman engages the East Coast, battling all his former villains and creations of Luthor and even his old teammate and possible lover, Wonder Woman. After Brainiac's ship collapses and threaten's the entire Earth, Superman flies it out into space where it goes off.</p><p>With Superman believed dead from the explosion, the Soviet Union falls apart and Luthor revolutionizes the world and mankind with peace and stability. A unifying government is formed, Luthor cures all disease, the entire solar system becomes colonized and humanities life-span becomes increased drastically. Lex Luthor dies at an age numbered near two thousand years old. At the funeral, Superman appears to have survived and is revealed to be able to live almost indefinitely. He takes the guise of a man similar to what he appears like in the main continuity and lives among the humans until the the Sun becomes a Red Giant.</p><p>Countless years in the future, Earth becomes threatened by the collapse of the Solar System's now Red Sun.

After emerging from the sun, He crushes Solaris in one panel, creates his wife out of a sample of DNA from Solaris, takes a fragment of a doomed planet and transforms it into a full blown living world. He has been stated to have circumnavigated the Universe, wrestled evil Gods, and fought battles unimaginable.

And this intricate, breathing jewel of diversity and wonder began to strain at its boundaries, eager to unfold. But the poor, undernourished little universe of rational science and common people had just encountered a monster from the top of the food chain; something stronger, faster, better than them had been born. They could no more stop its progress than the neanderthals could hold back the rise of Cro-Magnon man. Atom tried to reach his loved one and tell her that he’d find her again even if he had to search every inch of infinite... That is when the universe ate his. Nothing should have survived the explosive flowering of the singularity, but somehow, caught as he was between too realities...He finds himself at the Universal Gates where Superman Prime telling him he knows what he is feeling, and to try not to panic, Atom appears to have survived a dimensional collapse. He welcomes Atom to his universe and tells him that things happened so fast, even He couldn’t preserve Atom’s reality in time...Superman tells Atom that if there’s one thing he’s learned, it’s that nothing is lost forever. He tells Atom he is welcome to stay while Atom searches for the people he loves.</p><p>In All Star Superman, he is seen as the Leader of the Superman Squad, he hands All Star Superman an Indestructible Flower from New Krypton in remembrance of all that they are and all that will be. The Ultra-Sphinx also says that he had completed 12 super challenges, the stuff of legend. It also said that Superman had created life, escaped from the underverse, overthrew the tyrant sun (Solaris), and had answered the unanswerable question.</p><h3><a href="/all-star-superman/4050-18139/" data-ref-id="4050-18139"><em>All-Star Superman</em></a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-2493275" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2493275-allstarke3.jpg" data-ratio="1.4560327198364" data-width="489" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 489px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:145.6%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2493275-allstarke3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2493275"><img alt="All-Star Superman" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px" data-width="439" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/70123/2493275-allstarke3.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2493275-allstarke3.jpg 489w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/70123/2493275-allstarke3.jpg 439w"><noscript><img alt="All-Star Superman" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/70123/2493275-allstarke3.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2493275-allstarke3.jpg 489w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/70123/2493275-allstarke3.jpg 439w" sizes="(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px" data-width="439"></noscript></a><figcaption>All-Star Superman</figcaption></figure><p>Superman saves a space station that is studying and exploring the sun when it was sabotaged by <a href="/lex-luthor/4005-41952/" data-ref-id="4005-41952">Lex Luthor</a>.

His mother is alive, Atlantis and the Amazons have waged a massive war that has already destroyed much of Western Europe, and many heroes are either completely different or outright missing. One of these missing heroes is Superman, whom Barry tries to locate in an attempt to stop the Atlantis-Amazon war. With the help of Batman (whom in this incarnation is Thomas Wayne) he contacts Cyborg who discovers a secret plan dubbed simply as "Project Superman" the team infiltrate a secret government base, only to find a seemingly pail, weak, and frail man. In this timeline, Kal-El's rocket was shifted slightly and instead of landing in the Kent's farm, he landed right in the middle of Metropolis. He was then taken away by government agents and the landing was covered up. He has been kept in a secret facility and been deprived of yellow sun radiation and has had minimal human contact. After the Flash, Batman, and Cyborg free him of his prison, they are met with resistance by government soldiers. Superman uses his heat vision to attack the soldiers, he appears to be shocked by the use of his powers and flies away in horror.</p><p>In the final battle, Superman makes a re-appearance and attempts to stop the war, first by landing on Enchantress and then attempting to fight both Wonder Woman and Aquaman. This allows Flash a bit more time and he begins to run back in time to stop the events of Flashpoint from ever happening. Barry's effects upon the world lead to a reboot of the DC Universe in the New 52.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3><a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/injustice-gods-among-us/4050-56384/" data-ref-id="4050-56384"><em>Injustice: Gods Among Us</em></a></h3><p>When Superman hears to heartbeats coming from Lois Lane, he immediately realizes that she is pregnant. The first person he goes to when Lois goes to investigate a tip-off for the Daily Planet is Batman, whom Superman asks to be the child's godfather. However, while Superman and Batman converse, Lois and Jimmy Olsen are confronted by the Joker and Harley Quinn at the tip-off point - Joker immediately kills Jimmy and kidnaps Lois. When Superman discovers Jimmy to be dead and Lois missing, he gets the entire Justice League to help look for her. Eventually, they find Joker, Harley and Lois in a submarine. Superman immediately rips it open to find Joker and Harley operating on Lois and is confronted by Doomsday. Superman grabs Doomsday and flies straight up into space only to find that Joker had used a combination of Scarecrow's fear gas and kryptonite to make it appear that Lois was Doomsday - effectively making Superman Lois' killer. As well as this, Joker has attached a trigger to Lois' heart so that when she died, a nuclear bomb detonated in Metropolis, destroying the city.</p><p>After spending a while grieving over Lois and his unborn child at ground zero of the detonation, Superman gives Lois' body to Wonder Woman and flies to meet Green Lantern from whom he discovers where the Joker is being held prisoner. In an attempt to stop Superman from doing something he will regret, Green Lantern encases him in a ball. However, Superman easily breaks free and snatches the power ring from Lantern's finger. He then flies straight to Gotham Prison where he locates Joker (who is under interrogation from Batman) and shoves his arm straight through Joker's body, killing him. Deciding that enough is enough, Superman starts a self-enforced, global cease-fire by deposing a cruel dictator and announcing it to the world in addition to his secret identity at a press event alongside Wonder Woman.</p><p>Unhappy with Superman taking charge, the US Military captures Martha and Jonathon Kent and Mirror Master traps them inside a mirror, threatening to kill them if Superman doesn't relinquish his cease-fire. However, with the aid of various other super heroes, Superman is able to locate where Mirror Master is holding his parents and save them before their execution.</p><p>Superman and Lex Luthor have succeeded in creating superhuman technology.

The series followed the concept of Clark Kent in the spotlight, and focuses on the relationship between Lois and Clark. The series starts in 1966 with Jonathan and Martha Kent finding the baby Kal-El in a Kansas corn field and bringing him up their own son. Clark’s parents are much more prominent in this show than previous ones, as they’re shown visiting him often in Metropolis. Clark is around 27-30 when he comes to Metropolis and gets a job with the world-famous Daily Planet run by Perry White (Lane Smith). At the start of the series Lois views Clark as a pest when they are partnered, but Clark is smitten from the first and endures her jibes and taunts as well as the overtures of Lex Luthor, who appears in the first season and begins to court Ms. Lane, who is drawn to the charming businessman. Lex Luthor also wages his personal war against Superman, trapping the Man of Tomorrow with a Kryptonite trap, but Superman escapes and battles Luthor, who apparently falls to his death.</p><p>In season 2, Lois and Clark begin to date. Though they are constantly pulled in different directions and face various dangers, Lois soon finds out Clark's secret identity and in the season finale, Clark proposes to Lois, but she must know who is asking: Clark Kent or Superman? Lois is unsure because of how long Clark kept his double-life secret from her, so she is unsure that the marriage can work. This was also a device to delay the in-show wedding as it was meant to coincide with the marriage in the comics, which was delayed.

Max and Dave Fleischer (of Fleischer Studios) created this series primarily under the direction of Paramount Studios. It should be noted that Dave Fleischer, the animation lead on the project, actually collaborated with Joe Shuster on the look of Superman, thus seamlessly blending in Superman's original comic book look with the Fleischer's unique and beautiful brand of animation. It is difficult to underestimate just how important this serial has been on the rest of Superman mythology, print and visual culture. For example, this serial gave birth to many Superman stock phrases such as "faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound...", "this looks like a job for Superman!" and "look, up in the sky! Its a bird! Its a plane! Its Superman!" On a similar note, it has been mentioned that in the 1938 comics Superman was only able to leap tall buildings. It is in this series, in fact, where Superman learns to fly. For example, in the earlier 1941 cartoons Superman is seen getting a running start before taking off, a reference to its extension of his jumping ability, whereas by 1943 he had gained full control. The decision to transition from leaping to flying was made by the Fleischer brothers, who decided that leaping did not look right on film, whereas flying was much more visually appealing, being perfectly suited to the freedom that animation provided (Superman's flight effect looked so good in animation that it continued on into the live action 1948/1950 Kirk Alyn Superman serials for Columbia, where whenever Superman flies he is animated, and whenever he lands he conveniently ducks behind cover and emerges as the live action Alyn). Shortly after the introduction of flight in the animated serial the print Superman also gained the ability.</p><h4><a href="/super-friends/4075-185/" data-ref-id="4075-185"><em>Super Friends</em></a> (1973)</h4><h4><em>The All-New Super Friends Hour</em> (1977)</h4><h4><em>Challenge of the Super Friends</em> (1978)</h4><h4><em>The World's Greatest Super Friends</em> (1979)</h4><h4><em>Super Friends</em> (1980)</h4><h4><em>Super Friends "Lost Episodes"</em> (1983)</h4><h4><em>Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show</em> (1984)</h4><h4><em>The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians</em> (1985)</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-2143387" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2143387-super_friends.jpg" data-ratio="1.3333333333333" data-width="300" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:133.3%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2143387-super_friends.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2143387"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-width="300" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2143387-super_friends.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2143387-super_friends.jpg 300w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2143387-super_friends.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101435/2143387-super_friends.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-width="300"></noscript></a></figure><p>From 1973-1986, Superman was a member of the Super Friends, a kid-friendly version of the JLA.

He had an idea to make himself known again. His idea was to jump from a tall building into a tiny bucket. Unfortunately, the tank he was aiming for had already sprung a leak so he would be jumping to his death. As he was falling <a href="/superman/4005-1807/" data-ref-id="4005-1807"> Superman</a> came and saved Joe. Joe was mad at what he done but, Superman pointed out he would have been jumping into an inch of water. He was mad at the fact he had no job or anything now.</p><p> </p><p>After hearing of his misfortunes Superman felt pity on him and offered Joe a job at the Superman museum. He had been working there for a while, until one night when it was raining and stormy Joe happened to be next to the <a href="/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/" data-ref-id="4060-19241"> Legion of Super-Heroes</a> exhibit and lightning came through the window, striking him and the statues, knocking him out. When he woke up he had not only the powers of Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes, but a new personality out to destroy <a href="/batman/4005-1699/" data-ref-id="4005-1699"> Batman</a> and Superman. He was known as Composite-Superman.</p><p> </p><p>Joe had changed half his body to look like Batman while the other half looked like Superman and his skin color the same as <a href="/brainiac-5/4005-1255/" data-ref-id="4005-1255"> Brainiac 5</a>. He eventually called the two heroes and asked them to join their team and threatened if he could not he would expose their identity. He easily learned their identity by reading their minds. Then Batman and Superman had a talk with Composite Superman trying to see his face but Composite Superman had covered it with a layer of lead. They agreed to let Composite Superman join them, while in reality Composite Superman really just wanted to get back at Superman, Batman and his sidekick <a href="/robin/4005-1687/" data-ref-id="4005-1687"> Robin</a> (<a href="/tim-drake/4005-9290/" data-ref-id="4005-9290">Tim Drake</a>). He started trying to make the heroes look bad. He turned part of a building into <a href="/kryptonite/4055-32213/" data-ref-id="4055-32213"> Kryptonite</a> and as it was falling Superman tried to stop it, but became weak and people watched while Superman struggled to lift it up. But then Composite Superman lifted it with ease, saving the day and embarrassing Superman by making him look weak.</p><p> </p><p>Next he was with Batman and Robin late at night as they were tailing two crooks. Batman told him to stay back and let Robin and him handle this. As Batman and Robin were sliding down ropes to sneak up on the crooks Composite Superman instantly made them too heavy, forcing their ropes to break. Then he stretched his hands out to catch the bad guys and eventually he ended up saving the day. Superman and Batman started getting suspicious of Composite Superman and as they were speaking of a way to try and figure out what he was up to, Composite Superman was listening to them in disguise. Later he had changed into Robin and got in the <a href="/batmobile/4055-41463/" data-ref-id="4055-41463"> Batmobile</a>. Suddenly the top had closed on him and he was curious. He asked what’s wrong and Batman said he wasn’t Robin because Robin and Batman practiced wearing seat belts while driving. Composite Superman revealed himself and flew right through the roof of the Batmobile and knocked Batman out and took him away.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually he met up with Superman in his layer but before Superman had been looking around and realized that Composite Superman wasn’t just trying to take over the planet but in fact the whole universe. Superman tried to talk to him but a fight broke out. Superman was outmatched and only getting one punch in. Composite Superman then put a Kryptonite ring on Superman. He then flew off with Superman and Batman to lay waste to the two but while flying Batman and Superman both noticed that Composite Superman was flying slower as the moments passed and that he also was lowering down. He then dropped the two heroes and flew back to the museum. Their he tried to zap the statues of the Legion of Super-Heroes and give himself powers again but he ran out of juice and couldn’t. Then he tried to write on the paper of how he could turn back but stopped about mid way. Meanwhile Superman and Batman were falling down to their deaths. Batman pulled the Kryptonite ring off Superman so he could fly them away from their death. Batman managed to pull the ring off waking Superman and then Superman flew the two to safety. Meanwhile in the museum Joe woke up with a piece of paper in his hand reading what Composite Superman had left behind for him to see but couldn’t make it out due to the fact that it wasn’t finished leaving the heroes clueless to who Composite Superman really was.</p><p> </p><p>Composite Superman (Joseph Meach) was created by Edmund Hamilton, Curt Swan, George Klein and Shelly Moldoff.</p><p>Composite Superman (Xan) was created by Cary Burkett, George Tuska and Frank McLaughlin.</p><p> </p><h2>Post-Crisis</h2><p>This creature was created by accident by <a href="/professor-ivo/4005-22015/" data-ref-id="4005-22015"> Professor Ivo</a>. He originally tried to make clones of the <a href="/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/" data-ref-id="4060-31815"> Justice League</a> to serve him but had little success, or so he thought. He buried the failures and later made <a href="/amazo/4005-3737/" data-ref-id="4005-3737"> Amazo</a>. Later his attempted clones merged into one being and dug its way out of the ground. He broke into a costume shop and took a Superman and Batman costume. He sewed them together down the middle and went on trying to live out both Superman's and Batman's life. He tried to get rid of them and took both <a href="/lois-lane/4005-1808/" data-ref-id="4005-1808"> Lois Lane</a> and <a href="/tim-drake/4005-9290/" data-ref-id="4005-9290"> Tim Drake</a> hostage. He was later attacking <a href="/metallo/4005-4689/" data-ref-id="4005-4689"> Metallo</a> when Batman and Superman arrived, but the duo could not defeat him and he escaped. They tracked him down and told him if he wanted to be both of them then go ahead. They told him of many crimes taking place and he could not decide who to help first. He lost it and ripped himself apart before they could help him.</p><h2>Composite Superman/Batman Rocket Ship</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74414/1381498-supermanbatmanrocket.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1381498" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.52281616688396" data-width="767" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 767px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:52.3%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74414/1381498-supermanbatmanrocket.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1381498"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/74414/1381498-supermanbatmanrocket.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74414/1381498-supermanbatmanrocket.jpg 767w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/74414/1381498-supermanbatmanrocket.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/74414/1381498-supermanbatmanrocket.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></a></figure><p>When Asteroid X, a massive chunk of Kryptonite, was found to be hurtling towards the Earth, Superman and Batman contacted a young genius in <a href="/japan/4020-55746/" data-ref-id="4020-55746">Japan</a> named <a href="/hiro-okamura/4005-33525/" data-ref-id="4005-33525"> Hiro Okamura</a> to build something capable of taking care of the asteroid.

The radiation affected the machinery of the vessel and the shuttle crash landed somewhere far away from its intended target. When the four explorers had freed themselves from the wreckage, Hank discovered that his friends Steve and Jim had been horribly transformed. Steve had become living radiation and Jim's body had been destroyed and reformed out of debris from the ship and the surrounding area. Hank's wife <a href="/terri-henshaw/4005-13039/" data-ref-id="4005-13039">Terri</a> seemed to be fine, but Hank himself could feel radiation sickness beginning to eat away at him.</p><p>The group went to <a href="/metropolis/4020-41184/" data-ref-id="4020-41184">Metropolis</a> in search of a <a href="/lexcorp/4060-51472/" data-ref-id="4060-51472">LexCorp</a> facility that they could use to fix their mutations, but ran into <a href="/superman/4005-1807/" data-ref-id="4005-1807">Superman</a> and were subsequently involved in a time-consuming fight. Things were worked out but by then the radiation's effects on Hank had begun to show. His flesh was falling off his bones, and he was obviously close to death. Terri also started exhibiting symptoms, beginning to fade from existence. Hank tried his hardest to work on a cure for her, but he was going fast. While he worked, Steve flew into the sun and Jim killed himself. Hank came up with a plan to fix Terri, but died before he could use it. Thankfully, Superman was still there and he was able to save Terri before she completely disappeared.</p><p>Some time later, Hank returned in a new form. When his physical body had died, his consciousness had been turned to energy and sent into the machine on which he had been working. Somehow he had gained control over the machinery and was able to form it into a robotic body he could use as transport. His first thoughts once reconstituted were of his wife Terri, who had been institutionalized after the traumatic events which she had witnessed.</p><p>Henshaw found Terri, but after appearing as a robot and leaving suddenly when security came, Terri was left even more disturbed than before. When Henshaw heard how his visit had made Terri feel, he decided it would be best for him to leave Earth and continue his hunt for knowledge on his own. Henshaw found his way to Superman's birthing matrix and made it his new body so he could travel space again, absorbing the knowledge of the universe in the process. Superman found him and tried to stop him, but Hank flew away.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Hank Henshaw was created by <a href="/dan-jurgens/4040-4321/" data-ref-id="4040-4321">Dan Jurgens</a>.

Since Cyborg Superman is obviously insane and hates Superman, some things are clearly false, but with other changes, like the cause of the radiation storm and what happened with Terri, it's hard to tell if these re-tellings are just the result of a crazy man telling his story or official retcons. For that reason, any changes in the origin are in the following paragraph.</p><p>When the Cyborg met <a href="/mongul/4005-12162/" data-ref-id="4005-12162">Mongul</a>, it is revealed that for some reason Henshaw believes that Superman was responsible for his loss of humanity and that he had banished Hank from Earth.</p><p>When the Cyborg battled Blue Superman at the <a href="/source-wall/4020-42569/" data-ref-id="4020-42569">Source Wall</a>, he explained that Superman had caused the deaths of his friends because he was jealous and afraid of their abilities.

He also said that Terri had been near death when he went to see her as a machine and that he was trying to save her life but she jumped out of a window when she saw him and, as a result, Superman tried to kill him.</p><h3>New 52 / Prime Earth</h3><h4>Team 7</h4><figure data-ref-id="1300-2930039" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65423/2930039-drhenshaw2.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1.6955555555556" data-width="450" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 450px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:169.6%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65423/2930039-drhenshaw2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2930039"><img alt="New 52 - Dr Henshaw" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px" data-width="377" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/65423/2930039-drhenshaw2.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65423/2930039-drhenshaw2.jpg 450w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/65423/2930039-drhenshaw2.jpg 377w"><noscript><img alt="New 52 - Dr Henshaw" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/65423/2930039-drhenshaw2.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65423/2930039-drhenshaw2.jpg 450w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/65423/2930039-drhenshaw2.jpg 377w" sizes="(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px" data-width="377"></noscript></a><figcaption>New 52 - Dr Henshaw</figcaption></figure><p>In the issues 5-6 of <a href="/team-7/4060-25145/" data-ref-id="4060-25145">Team 7</a>, We see a person named Dr. Henshaw, who worked for the Advanced Prosthetic Research Center as head of robotics geneticist.

A short time later Hank asked The Anti-Monitor if he would kill him after he had fulfilled his purpose, The Anit-Monitor promised Hank that he would succeed where Superman and Hal Jordan had failed and would destroy Hank once he had done everything that was asked of him. With tears welling up in his organic eye, Hank thanked The Anti-Monitor for his "compassion" and returned to his duties.

Henshaw returned to the battle while Superman and the others fought with Prime and continued to fight Green Lanterns and the heroes of Earth.

Henshaw was incinerated when Warworld collided with The Anti-Monitor and exploded, but before he died he gave thanks to Guy and John for granting him his greatest wish.</p><p>Most of his body survived the explosion and retained more damage when Prime hurled the Anti-Moniter into space.

Cyborg Superman somehow survived his death. In the Reign of Doomsday the tie in to the Death Of Superman crossover series in 1993. Cyborg Superman was seen in the Reign of Doomsday crossover in <a href="/justice-league-of-america-eclipso-rising-part-two-mayhem/4000-266494/" data-ref-id="4000-266494">Justice League of America issue #55</a> Boodikka was talking to Supergirl with the aid of Batman helping her recover from the war on New Krypton aftermath and all of a sudden Doomsday came and crashed the party.</p><p>Batman survived from his space suit, and with Supergirl took Boodikka back to the Justice League Watchtower. Doomsday found them and a voice said that "It wanted me, not the JLA." Cyborg Superman was in Boodikka's body as nano bytes. Boodikka's body turned out to be Cyborg Superman. After the attack on the JLA Watchtower, Cyborg Superman was beaten up very badly by Doomsday. He killed Doomsday, but Doomsday had a upgrade in his armor. Batman and Supergirl attacked Doomsday, but Doomsday got very strong and destroyed the Cyborg Superman and took Supergirl out of the JLA Watchtower.</p><p>Cyborg Superman and Supergirl were captured in a maze ship in space with the rest of the Supermen like Steel and Superboy with Eradicator, and Superman helped them try to find their way off the ship and away from the army of Doomsdays that were coming to attack them. Cyborg Superman told Superman that there are different Doomsdays to get them. Superman had enough of Cyborg Superman talking, and he punched him and ripped out his metal heart to power him down. After the Doomslayer, Original Doomsday and the Doomsday clones were sent to another dimension, Henshaw is taken into custody by S.T.A.R. Labs.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>As a result of the cosmic radiation, Hank Henshaw underwent a rapid degeneration but at the moment of his death, his consciousness jumped into a nearby computer. From that point on, his consciousness became tied to machines. He can possess machines and anything even remotely electronically mechanical and is able to control them completely with an ability he calls "technomorphing".</p><p>Unlike most technopaths, he doesn't just command them, he incorporates them into himself and any nearby technology becomes an extension of himself. He can take any machine and, once it's a part of him, he can transform it into anything his mind can imagine, and thanks to his time spent traveling across the universe, he can imagine a lot. And, even before becoming a living energy signal, Hank Henshaw was a genius, so this only adds to what he can come up with. The Cyborg is not limited by the uses or parts in the original machine, which makes this ability all the more dangerous.</p><p>Due to the fact that parts of the Cyborg are cloned from Superman's DNA, he has many of the Man of Steel's powers. He has exhibited heat vision (and other kinds of vision), super strength, super speed, invulnerability, and flight. It is assumed that if he created biological lungs for himself he could duplicate Superman's freeze breath, but he has not done so at this time.</p><p>As with machines though, Cyborg Superman can modify his Kryptonian parts beyond their original limits and weaknesses. He has already removed his <a href="/kryptonite/4055-32213/" data-ref-id="4055-32213">Kryptonite</a> weakness and his understanding of biology seems so complete that he can create more living Kryptonian parts from machinery. Cyborg Superman is also immortal, being able to live no matter what happens to his physical body. Currently, Cyborg Superman possess several <a href="/green-power-ring/4055-41361/" data-ref-id="4055-41361">Green Lantern Rings</a> and ten <a href="/qwardians/4060-39355/" data-ref-id="4060-39355">Qwardian</a>, <a href="/sinestro-corps-ring/4055-53415/" data-ref-id="4055-53415">Sinestro Corps Power Rings</a>.</p><p>These weapons are not just for show either. He seldom uses them, usually relying on his Kryptonian powers, however, when he did use them he appeared to be rather adept. Other weapons at his disposal include Willhunters, nanites which he uses to enslave a person's mind and make them loyal to the Manhunters, as well as hundreds of Manhunter robots which he has upgraded and started mass producing to obey his every command.</p><p>Recently, he took control of The <a href="/alpha-lanterns/4060-49719/" data-ref-id="4060-49719">Alpha Lanterns</a> just as he once did with the Manhunters and has been reproducing Alpha Lantern batteries in order to turn Lanterns that have been kidnapped by his new soldiers into Alpha Lanterns themselves.

He was sighted in dozens of states in the US, and revealed his immence powers... Mainly to help people...</p><p>Meanwhile, the CIA's top Scientist <a href="/lex-luthor/4005-41952/" data-ref-id="4005-41952">Lex Luthor</a> was planning to make a clone of the "Super-man", "His American Equal" Luthor called it, but to everyone else, the hideous clone was dubbed " <a href="/bizarro/4005-8312/" data-ref-id="4005-8312">Bizarro</a>".</p><p>After a fairly short fight against Bizarro, Superman became victorius, when Bizarro gave up and flew into the Sun. Which marked Luthor's first of many failures against the Comrade of Steel. He created dozens of other monsters to battle the Soviet Superman, such as The <a href="/parasite/4005-4690/" data-ref-id="4005-4690">Parasite</a>, <a href="/metallo/4005-4689/" data-ref-id="4005-4689">Metallo</a>, The <a href="/atomic-skull/4005-13006/" data-ref-id="4005-13006">Atomic Skull</a>, and several others, which were only seen in a wax museum dedicated to Superman's greatness. However, one of Luthor's plans did turn out to have some success, he managed to talk <a href="/brainiac/4005-4684/" data-ref-id="4005-4684">Brainiac</a> into stealing a heavily populated Russian city, not the one of his choosing, but still a great loss for Superman none the less...</p><p>And, while America's economy was going to hell because of the Soviet Union's superiority, Superman began making a negotiation with the Amazons to join the Communist side, which they agreed to, and enlisted Wonder Woman as another champion of the Communist Party.</p><p>Together, Superman and <a href="/wonder-woman/4005-2048/" data-ref-id="4005-2048">Wonder Woman</a> traveled the world and converted other countries to the Communist Party, except for America, which refused to join Soviet Russia's empire... But by that time they were faced with their first major threat, " <a href="/batmankoff/4005-70711/" data-ref-id="4005-70711">Batmankoff</a>", who has an everlasting vendetta against the Communist Party after a Soviet officer shot and killed his mom and dad, which inspired him to become a one-man-army against Russia's New Utopia Superman has built for it. His first attack against the Comrade of Steel was during a festival in honor of Superman, and when the fireworks went off--that was suppose to shape as Superman's Sickle and Hammer Insignia--was replaced by Batmankoff's alarming Symbol. This triggered Superman to go after Batmankoff, where he found Wonder Woman on top of a building, tied up with her own Lasso of Truth, warning Superman of Batkoff's trap when it was too late. He emerged from the shadows, holding a detonater in his hand, which Superman saw led to an explosive inside Batkoff's small intestine, which did not seem like an admirable threat to Superman, until Batmankoff triggered a Sun-lamp all around the top of the building. Which confused Superman even more, and did not notice what Batmankoff's true intention was, until he punched the Comrade of Steel in the jaw, knocking him over like any ordinary man. Batmankoff explained to him how it was the Solar lamps that took away his powers, and it was suppose to simulate is native Red Sun--which was Lex Luthor's idea, before again kicking him while he's down once more. But after Superman's beating from Batmankoff, he threw the Comrade of Steel into an average closet and locked him in like some sort of animal... With Batkoff suggesting the only alternitive for Superman to Wonder Woman is to put him out of his misery once and for all. That's when Wonder Woman used her great strength to somehow break free from her Magic Lasso--scarring her horribly-- but, she managed to save Superman and get him back into the rays of the yellow sun in time to get off the building before Batmankoff blew himself up.</p><p>Soon after Superman's Confrontation with Batmankoff, and the passing of Leader of Soviet Russia <a href="/josef-stalin/4005-28624/" data-ref-id="4005-28624">Josef Stalin</a>, Superman was appointed by the People of Russia to become the New leader of the Communist Party. Superman, and the newly "Reprogrammed" Brainiac, shaped Russia into a nigh-perfect Utopia, Similiar to Krypton, but where Criminals were Lobonized By Brainiac and Programmed to Dress as Batmankoff and clean the Streets of Ukraine, and Brainiac even tapped into the atmosphere to even gain control of the Weather, So no one would be inconvienianced by being caught without an umbrella in the rain. Superman Even bragged that No one Ever complained--Even to themselves...</p><p>And sure enough, by that time the now balding Lex Luthor gained another weapon to fight Superman with, that he found on the finger of an alien who crashed landed somewhere in Texas.. The Ring was able to multiply itself thouasnds of times at Lex's will, and he enlisted and entire Corps to bear the Power Ring in order to fight Superman with, namely an ex Prisoner of War <a href="/hal-jordan/4005-11202/" data-ref-id="4005-11202">Hal Jordan</a>, and several others with the last name " <a href="/guy-gardner/4005-1791/" data-ref-id="4005-1791">Gardener</a>", " <a href="/alan-scott/4005-12663/" data-ref-id="4005-12663">Scott</a>", " <a href="/kyle-rayner/4005-40431/" data-ref-id="4005-40431">Rayner</a>", and " <a href="/john-stewart/4005-10451/" data-ref-id="4005-10451">Stewart</a>", hinting on he enlisted the same <a href="/green-lantern/4015-41148/" data-ref-id="4015-41148">Green Lanterns</a> as the ones in most of the other Universes. However, The GLC did not stand a chance against the Superman, as he remarked after taking Hal's Ring;</p><blockquote><p><a href="/green-power-ring/4055-41361/" data-ref-id="4055-41361">"<em>A Thought based weapon against someone who can move at ten times the speed of thought? not Too smart, Colonel Jordan</em>.."</a></p></blockquote><p>And Thus, foiling yet another one of Lex's Plans.</p><p>However, the Soviet Union had control of nearly the entire world by then-- all except for the stubborn nation of America, that was in complete poverty because of The Soviet's control over nearly all trading.. Brainiac had been "Reprogrammed" To serve Superman and Soviet Russia, Lex Luthor was completely bald by then, and out of ideas, and all conflict seemed to be at an end... Until, Luthor decided to send an All-out invasion on Russia as a last-ditch effort, and Brainiac insisted on Superman attacking them first, to lessen the death-toll, and Superman headed to Washington, and was confronted by Wonder Woman and the Amazons on his way there. But as usual, they barely put up a fight and arrived at Washington, to be greeted by just about every rogue he's ever battled all at once, Such as the Atomic Skull, Parasite, Metallo--even <a href="/doomsday/4005-9989/" data-ref-id="4005-9989">Doomsday</a>.</p><p>In the midst of the battle Brainiac arrived in his giant <a href="/brainiacs-skull-ship/4055-55821/" data-ref-id="4055-55821">Skull Ship</a>, and attacked the Comrade of Steel, revealing even Superman was unsuccessful in Reprogramming him. And During the fight Superman advised Mrs. Luthor (Lois Luthor) to evacuate the area, but she refused to go. Superman confronted her when she handed him something she assumed could beat even him, an envelope. He opened it, and inside it, he found a note, reading "<em>Why don't you just put the whole world in a bottle?" ...</em>which brought him to his knees in pain, knowing that the Soviet Union was merely using him to their advantage. Meanwhile, inside Brainiac's ship, Luthor was busy trying to destroy him from the inside, and set off a self-destruct mechanism. Superman managed to get Luthor out, and flew the ship into space as fast as he could go--And Brainiac calculated not even at his fastest speed he could avoid the planet-shattering blast, but Superman disposed of the ship with half a second to spare, and was never seen again by the public eye...</p><p>He then spent the remainder of his life as a mild mannered reporter named Clark Kent, to see what the world is like through human eyes, Like many of his alternate counterparts... It is unknown if he still resumed his role as Superman afterwords, but it is implied during his next few appearances.</p><p>In the end of the story, a very distant future of the Earth is showed, a time in wich the sun of the earth become red, and the earth is going to explode. A man called Jor-L, long descendant of Lex Luthor, try to save his son from the explosion, launching him with a rockt back in time. The baby is called Kal-L, and in the last page is rocket is showed falling in Ukraina, in the 1938, revealing that Kal-L, Red Son Superman is not an alien coming from Krypton but a human coming from an extremely evolved Earth of distant future</p><p>He also Made a Brief Appearance as Superman during The "Superman / Batman: With a Vengance" Story Arc when <a href="/batzarro/4005-40547/" data-ref-id="4005-40547">Batzarro</a> inadvertantly teleports into Earth-30, and the Comrade of Steel attempted to throw him down a Smoke-Stack to kill him... But somehow, Batzarro survived. And plagued the Communist Superman briefly before returning back to New Earth.

But since this "Future Earth" semble in all aspect Krypton [including a red sun], in the following section the term "Kryptonian" is used for sake of convenience.</em></p><p>Red Son Superman has all the following powers of regular Superman, including :</p><h4>Solar Battery</h4><p>As a if it was a "Kryptonian", Kal-L possesses the ability to absorb the solar energy from yellow stars. His "Kryptonian" body is constantly absorbing and storing energy from Earth's yellow sun (allowing him to retain energy under roofed structures and even at night) which in turn grants him incredible powers, including superhuman strength, enhanced senses, impenetrable skin, and the ability to defy gravity.</p><p><b>Super-Strength</b></p><p>Superman has the ability to physically lift impossibly massive amounts of weight. Superman easily surpasses the Class 100 strength level (this is the ability to lift over 100 tons under normal conditions) and has no known limit. Superman's strength is aided in lifting/supporting the most massive objects--especially when flying--by the bio-electric force field his body produces.</p><h4><b>Super-Speed</b></h4><p>Superman has the ability to move and fly incredibly fast. He shows the ability to achieve speeds faster than light.</p><p><b>Telescopic, Microscopic, X-Ray, and Heat Vision</b></p><p>Kal-L is able to see over great distances and perceive even the smallest of objects. This vision also allows him to see through the atomic structure of an object, though he is unable to see through lead.</p><p>Superman’s physiology can convert stored solar energy into beams of highly concentrated thermal energy which can reach temperatures comparable to those produced by stars. The two beams of energy which are released from his eyes are bright red in color, but at lower temperatures can be made invisible, allowing him to work undetected.</p><h4><b>Super Hearing</b></h4><p>Kal-L has the super human ability to hear all sounds at any volume or pitch and across any distance, presumably as long as there is atmosphere to carry the sonic vibrations.</p><h4><b>Superhuman Stamina</b></h4><p>Superman’s "Kryptonian" physiology allows him exert himself to physical peak for an undetermined amount of time. When Kal-L is under a star with a yellow spectrum he is constantly replenishing his solar reserves. When Kal-L is under a G type dwarf star with a yellow spectrum his solar energies are constantly being replenished.</p><h4><strong>Invulnerability</strong></h4><p>Red Son Superman has incredible durability. He has taken hits from the U.S.'s Bizarro, Amazonians, Green Lanterns, and more. However, his invulnerability can be compromised by Red Sun Radiation, which Batmankoff demonstrated.</p><p><b>Flight</b></p><p>While Superman's body is charged with solar energy he is able to emit a gravitational field that enables him to defy gravity. Kal-L has extreme mobility while he is in flight allowing him to fight, change course, and also carry great weights. While in Earth's atmosphere Kal-L is able to move at supersonic speed; while in space, he can move at superluminal speeds. Kal-L tends to avoid moving at FTL speeds while in a planet’s atmosphere so that he does not harm the area around him. Kal-L has been seen flying from the Earth to the moon in mere seconds.</p><h4><b>Super Breath /</b> <b>Freeze Breath</b></h4><p>Kal-L has the ability to suck in a large amount of air into his lungs and either hold it within him for a long period of time or create strong forces of wind with it. Kal-L also has the ability to freeze his enemies using his breath. He is able to control the temperature with which he expels this power. Superman's ability to chill the large intake of air comes from his lungs compressing the inhaled air and then upon its exhalation, the sudden increase in the volume of gas causes its temperature to drop dramatically.</p><h4><b>Longevity</b></h4><p>Yellow sun powered "Kryptonian" can live almost indefinitely.</p><h4><b>Total Recall</b></h4><p>Kal-L has the ability to instantly recall events that he pays specific attention to or that hold great emotional significance to him. When he has absorbed solar energy he has the ability to solve problems with superhuman speed.</p><h3>Weaknesses, Limitations, and Vulnerabilities</h3><h4><b>Magic</b></h4><p>Superman is still a mortal and is, as such, still as vulnerable to the workings of magic, in all its forms, as anyone else. <a href="/wonder-woman/4005-2048/" data-ref-id="4005-2048">Wonder Woman</a>'s <a href="/wonder-womans-tiara/4055-51489/" data-ref-id="4055-51489">Tiara</a> is magical and can therefore be used to injure Superman, for he is susceptible to magic. Note that while this is true for most incarnation of Superman, Red Son have never been show fight magic using enemy, so he may not have this weakness </p><h4><b>Kryptonite</b></h4><p>Since he is not really a Kryptonian, and in this universe seem to be no Krypton [Kal-L come from a future version of our earth], is unknow if Red Son Superman have this weaknes. No Kryptonite has been showed durring the "Superman: Red Son" series. Anyway is possible that some  fragment of the future Earth [that have crossed time] may have on Red Son the same effect of "Kryptonie": the mineral causes Superman to lose his powers and experience extraordinary pain and eventually death. If from suffering <a href="/kryptonite/4055-32213/" data-ref-id="4055-32213">Kryptonite</a> poisoning, he can recover if he gets away from the Kryptonite and exposes himself to yellow sun radiation, thus fueling his healing factor. Kryptonite has been known to cause harm such as cancer to humans after prolonged exposure to its radiation.

Following the 'construction' of the island, Superman makes the cliffs on the island steep enough so that no ship could land there and landscapes the island with red, blue and white plants so as to make the island in his own image. Rather than arrogance, he explains that the unique appearance of the so called Superman Island was to prevent anyone from accidentally landing on the island.</p><p>Furthermore, in order to prevent navigation problems, Superman outfits the island with an enormous lighthouse and foghorns to aid in navigation at night or in fog. The lighthouse even projects a massive projection of him instead of a normal beam of light. There are also air canons to prevent airplanes from landing on the island. On the island, Superman begins constructing machines to aid in constructing a giant vault.</p><p>Needless to say, Superman constructing a giant island in his own image and preventing anyone from landing on it piques peoples' curiosity. <a href="/lois-lane/4005-1808/" data-ref-id="4005-1808">Lois Lane</a> investigates and inquires to a professor named Vanley, whom Superman had recently talked too about an unknown project. Whilst talking to him, Vanley's experimental generator breaks down, knocking him unconscious. following this, Lois asks a group of sailors to take her to Superman Island for $100. When arriving there, they find a hidden opening to aid in case of shipwreck victims.</p><p>On the island, the two sailors reveal themselves as crooks wishing to exploit the treasures they believe to be on the island. Instead, they find that the reason Superman had constructed the island and was using tools to load things into a vault was that he had gathered all of the <a href="/kryptonite/4055-32213/" data-ref-id="4055-32213">Kryptonite </a>on Earth he could find. The reason, as Lois finds out after being rescued from the thugs who wish to sell the Kryptonite to the 'underworld', was that Superman had asked Vanley to build a test generator to see if nuclear power can be derived from Kryptonite. Unfortunately, Kryptonite crumbles any generator it touches.

Mostly, a Silver age trope.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p> </p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The Superman robots are robots that physically resemble <a href="https://www.comicvine.com/superman/4005-1807/" data-ref-id="4005-1807">Superman</a>, including his powers. More commonly seen in the Silver Age, the Man of Steel had then many robots that would help him keep his identity secret, posing either as Superman or as Clark Kent. At first the robots were just dummies, which Superman moved at super speed and he would throw his voice to make it seem like they were talking. Later on they became moving speaking automatons, which could act as Superman himself and serve also as maintance crew for the Fortress of Solitude.</p><p>Originally, it was the Silver age Superboy who used a pack of five robots to keep his identity as Clark Kent a secret. The advanced AI from the robots allowed some of them to develop selfconscious. Among the most notable example of robots are: Adam Newman, <a href="https://www.comicvine.com/wonder-man/4005-39248/" data-ref-id="4005-39248">Ajax</a>, Powerman, Robot X-3, Robot Z and MacDuff. But most of the time, the robots were only background characters with no development. There were also Clark Kent and Supergirl versions of the robots for the same purposes.</p><p>The Superman robots had all the powers of Superman in lower levels (the bigger exception was Superman-X), but they were immune to Kryptonite poisoning.</p><p>In the modern age, the Superman robots would resurface rarely as invention of Professor Hamilton. His massive irruption would happen when, under the mental influence of <a title="Dominus" href="/dominus/4005-13090/" data-ref-id="4005-13090">Dominus</a>, Superman decided that the Earth populace needed to be protected at all times. To that end, Superman (pushed by the mental powers of Dominus) created the robotic legion of Supermen as a superpowered police force intended to keep humanity safe -- even from itself. This legion of Super robots would mantain tasks sucha as prevent crime, disasters and keep perpetual vigilance in loved ones (as Lois Lane) and enemies (as Lex Luthor). After recovering from his mental possession, Superman had all of the Superman robots destroyed except for one named "Ned", presumiblely, the same one who watched over Lois Lane, who watches <a href="https://www.comicvine.com/krypto/4005-8332/" data-ref-id="4005-8332">Krypto</a> in the <a href="https://www.comicvine.com/fortress-of-solitude/4020-41185/" data-ref-id="4020-41185">Fortress</a>, and acts as guardian/playmate for the non-superintelligent, though superpowered, dog.</p><p>The rest of the robots Superman would have decommissioned and put in a storage in Pluto, until Batman reactivated and modified them as a robot JLA to stop Grodd. Depiste the plan, it was a failure. The plan gives the League time to return to Earth.</p><p>One other defective Superman robot was kept in STAR Labs until it was reactivated by <a href="/indigo/4005-3408/" data-ref-id="4005-3408">Indigo</a> and caused the deaths of <a href="/lilith-clay/4005-12525/" data-ref-id="4005-12525">Lilith Clay</a> and <a href="/donna-troy/4005-4913/" data-ref-id="4005-4913">Donna Troy</a>, before being defeated by the Titans and Young Justice.</p><p> </p><h2>Alternate versions</h2><p>On <a href="https://www.comicvine.com/superman-red-son/4050-10943/" data-ref-id="4050-10943">Superman: Red Son</a>, the Superman-Robots are actually brainwashed soviet citizens.</p><p>In All-Star Superman, more robotic looking Superman Robots assist Superman in the Fortress of Solitude. One of the Superman Robots, Superman Robot Seven, is hacked by <a href="https://www.comicvine.com/lex-luthor/4005-41952/" data-ref-id="4005-41952">Lex Luthor</a>. When Superman manufactures an exogene serum that grants a human Kryptonian powers for twenty-four hours,Superman Robot Seven smuggles the formula to Luthor. Later, when <a href="https://www.comicvine.com/solaris/4005-23273/" data-ref-id="4005-23273">Solaris the Tyrant Sun</a> attacks the sun, Superman has the Robots shut down the Fortress of Solitude. One stays behind to guard it as the power turns off.. During the fight with Solaris, all Superman robots seen perish, including Superman Robot Seven, who is seeking redemption for betraying Superman.</p><p>On earth-16, the Superman Robots kept the order in the planet. This caused worldwide ennui and depression among superheros as they found their lives without purpose. Later, their programing was spoiled by Alexis Luthor.</p><p>On the Tangent Universe the stronghold of that world's Superman is protected by fearsome-looking insectoid robots.</p><p>Alan Moore's Supreme would homage the concept with the Suprematons.</p><p>The trope also had a homage in Kurt Busiek's Astro CIty with Atomicus and his Atomic duplicates.</p><h2>Other media appearances</h2><p>Superman: The Animated Series: A Superman-Robot appears when Superman was kidnapped by <a href="https://www.comicvine.com/darkseid/4005-2349/" data-ref-id="4005-2349">Darkseid</a>.</p><p>Justice League: The episode "<em>A Better World</em>" stars several robots.</p><p>Legion of Superheroes: A robot resembling Cyborg Superman appears.</p><p>The All Star Superman animated adaptation also includes the presence of the Superman robots.</p>]]></description><first_appeared_in_issue><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-118921/]]></api_detail_url><id>118921</id><name/><issue_number>56</issue_number></first_appeared_in_issue><id>61778</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/796154-supermanrobots01.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/796154-supermanrobots01.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/796154-supermanrobots01.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/796154-supermanrobots01.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/796154-supermanrobots01.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/796154-supermanrobots01.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/796154-supermanrobots01.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Superman

Superman takes on crises as they arise. He is so fast and powerful that if a bad thing happens, he will shoot over and stop it so fast that whatever hapless villain was making a stir ends up in jail faster than light. Batman prefers a crushing, preemptive strike. If a crisis will happen, you can guarantee that the Dark Knight will have known about it and already have a detailed, workable plan formulated to stop it. Crises don't happen in Batman's territory-for the Caped Crusader stops them before they start. Given that these approaches are totally different, it's odd that these two would work together.</p><p>But Superman and Batman actually have their own team-that is how often they collaborate to fight evil.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13344/278660-58723-superman--batman.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-278660" data-size="medium" style="width: 400px" data-ratio="1" data-width="400" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13344/278660-58723-superman--batman.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-278660"><img alt="Team Up Logo" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13344/278660-58723-superman--batman.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13344/278660-58723-superman--batman.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-width="400"></a><figcaption>Team Up Logo</figcaption></figure><p>Much of the distance is in power discrepancy. Superman can move faster then the speed of light. He is literally impossible to damage in any physical way-only magic and Kryptonite affect him. He has nearly unlimited strength-he has moved planets. He never tires and he has an array of other weapons. His heat vision can melt steel, he can freeze nearly anything with ice breath, his super breath can make airplanes stop in midair, and he can fly. He is nearly unstoppable.</p><p>Batman has no powers-he is merely a man. But Batman is honed to the physical and mental peak.

His reason-a Kryptonite asteroid is heading towards Earth, and Luthor blames Superman.

Before Dick became Batman with Damian Wayne as his Robin, Clark was still struggling with Bruce dying. While he wasn't actually dead, however, lost in time, Superman and the other heroes didn't know yet. While other heroes missed Bruce greatly, Superman was the one who missed him the most. Clark and Bruce were the worlds finest heroes, they fought one another, however also destroyed a whole bunch of crime together. With Bruce gone, Superman felt guilty for not being the "man of steel (or shield)" for his best friend. When Dick Grayson was beginning his early days as Batman, Dick was testing one of his pre-suits before his modern suit. Superman got really angry at this point, because he missed his friend Bruce, so eventually with the help of Wonder Woman, Superman adjusted to Dick being Batman.</p><h3>Supergirl and Damian Wayne</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1363893-15770_400x600.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1363893" data-size="medium" style="width: 400px" data-ratio="1.5" data-width="400" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:150.0%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1363893-15770_400x600.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1363893"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-width="400" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1363893-15770_400x600.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1363893-15770_400x600.jpg 400w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1363893-15770_400x600.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1363893-15770_400x600.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-width="400"></noscript></a></figure><p>This was a short team-up that had Kara Kent (Supergirl) teaming up with Robin (Damian Wayne). When there was a massive death count in <a data-ref-id="4020-56534" href="/suicide-slums/4020-56534/">Suicide Slums</a>, Supergirl went seeking for a Master Detective. Mainly Dick Grayson or Tim Drake. However, instead she found Damian Wayne in a situation against <a data-ref-id="4005-3725" href="/killer-croc/4005-3725/">Killer Croc</a>. When Damian told Supergirl that Dick Grayson was with the <a data-ref-id="4060-31815" href="/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/">Justice League Of America</a> and Tim was following his own adventure, Supergirl was going to just leave Damian with taking Killer Croc to jail. But unknown to her, Damian surprised her with talking about the killings in Suicide Slum. After grudgingly listening to Damian boast in himself, Supergirl knew that she needed to capture the killer, and allowed Damian to work with her. Later in the <a data-ref-id="4020-41184" href="/metropolis/4020-41184/">Metropolis</a> city Morgue. Damian and Supergirl were studying the bodies of the victims that were killed in Suicide Slum. The victims eventually led to Scarecrow, and the team (Damian and Supergirl) beat him with ease and took him jail.</p><h3>Damian and Conner</h3><p>In the not to distant future, Damian Wayne is Batman with Conner Kent as Superman. Superman and Batman (Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne) both died protecting the universe from an omega level threat. To replace them, Conner Kent has chosen to become the newest Superman and Damian Wayne as Batman. For a mysterious reason (probably something in the past before the deaths of Superman and Batman) Damian and Conner hate one another. However, once every year, they join one another at midnight to honor the two most important/influential people in their lives, Clark and Bruce. Damian and Conner are portrayed in their late 50's to early or mid 60's. Damian states that he is training Terry McGinnis to be the newest Batman, while Conner is about to retire his cape to someone else.</p>]]></description><first_appeared_in_issue><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-120155/]]></api_detail_url><id>120155</id><name><![CDATA[The Mightiest Team in the World!; The Misfit Manhunter; Mrs. Superman]]></name><issue_number>76</issue_number></first_appeared_in_issue><id>40474</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/2394127-ac11.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/2394127-ac11.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/2394127-ac11.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/2394127-ac11.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/2394127-ac11.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2394127-ac11.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/2394127-ac11.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Superman/Batman]]></name><publisher><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/publisher/4010-10/]]></api_detail_url><id>10</id><name><![CDATA[DC Comics]]></name></publisher><site_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/superman-batman/4060-40474/]]></site_detail_url><resource_type><![CDATA[team]]></resource_type></team><team><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-58873/]]></api_detail_url><count_of_isssue_appearances>0</count_of_isssue_appearances><count_of_team_members>8</count_of_team_members><date_added>2012-01-06 02:25:21</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-10-07 14:08:00</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[A team consisted of super criminals, quite possibly once inmates of the Phantom Zone, with a grudge against Superman and his legacy.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Origin</h2><p>After having teleported on-board the <a data-ref-id="4020-41185" href="/fortress-of-solitude/4020-41185/">Fortress of Solitude</a>, its members were able to invade it as it was still unable to protect itself from Time Travelers.

He and Whitey Krell were caught robbing the Fifth National Bank. Both men are part of a gang responsible for a major crime wave in Metropolis. The leader of the organization is unknown to everyone, even those pulling the jobs. According to Barlow, who is attached to a lie detector, the leader planning everything is only called Mister X. Even Police Inspector Bill Henderson's best officer Sergeant Helen J. O'Hara is baffled by this case. She's even been trying to get into Mister X's syndicate somehow. This impresses Superman. After Inspector Henderson introduces her to him, the Man of Steel and O'Hara discuss her investigation. Our hero then does something that takes everyone by surprise. He asks O'Hara to marry him. The lovely sergeant accepts his proposal. This could prove to be dangerous for O'Hara should Mister X get wind of her nuptials to Superman.</em> <b></b></p>]]></description><has_staff_review></has_staff_review><id>21697</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/5693346-3450764-adv_title_screen.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/5693346-3450764-adv_title_screen.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/5693346-3450764-adv_title_screen.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/5693346-3450764-adv_title_screen.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/5693346-3450764-adv_title_screen.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/5693346-3450764-adv_title_screen.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/5693346-3450764-adv_title_screen.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><episode_number>609</episode_number><name><![CDATA[Superman's Wife]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/adventures-of-superman-609-supermans-wife/4070-21697/]]></site_detail_url><series><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/series/4075-151/]]></api_detail_url><id>151</id><name><![CDATA[Adventures of Superman]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/adventures-of-superman/4075-151/]]></site_detail_url></series><resource_type><![CDATA[episode]]></resource_type></episode><episode><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/episode/4070-21636/]]></api_detail_url><air_date/><date_added>2017-02-09 19:39:50</date_added><date_last_updated>2017-02-09 19:44:16</date_last_updated><deck/><description><![CDATA[<p> Diner owner Tony  keeps a pair of protection racketeers from bothering him by claiming (falsely) to be close friends with Superman.

Both the Daily Planet and Superman are actively involved in the Children's Camp Fund, and Pebble has some land that would be perfect for the charity's use. Money for the site will come from a silver mine that Pebble has named Superman Silver Mine in honor of the Man of Steel. This news could most certainly make the youngsters of Metropolis very happy. Gangster Dan Dobey and his henchman Boris have been in a slump lately. However, Lois Lane's article on Harrison Pebble and the Superman Silver Mine in the Planet give them an idea. Dobey is a dead ringer for Pebble. The only differences are Dobey has no mustache, and he has a metal plate in his head from an injury to his skull in an automobile accident. Dan Dobey could pass himself off as Pebble without any problems. Should he be able to do so, the Superman Silver Mine and its wealth could fall into the criminal's greedy hands. Dan Dobey may get more than he bargained for if Superman discovers his evil plot.</em> <b></b></p>]]></description><has_staff_review></has_staff_review><id>21694</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/5693346-3450764-adv_title_screen.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/5693346-3450764-adv_title_screen.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/5693346-3450764-adv_title_screen.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/5693346-3450764-adv_title_screen.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/5693346-3450764-adv_title_screen.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/5693346-3450764-adv_title_screen.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/5693346-3450764-adv_title_screen.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><episode_number>606</episode_number><name><![CDATA[The Superman Silver Mine]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/adventures-of-superman-606-the-superman-silver-min/4070-21694/]]></site_detail_url><series><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/series/4075-151/]]></api_detail_url><id>151</id><name><![CDATA[Adventures of Superman]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/adventures-of-superman/4075-151/]]></site_detail_url></series><resource_type><![CDATA[episode]]></resource_type></episode><series><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/series/4075-174/]]></api_detail_url><count_of_episodes>12</count_of_episodes><date_added>2013-11-24 17:40:13</date_added><date_last_updated>2013-11-24 17:41:27</date_last_updated><deck/><description/><first_episode><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/episode/4070-22067/]]></api_detail_url><id>22067</id><name><![CDATA[The Big Scoop]]></name><episode_number>105</episode_number></first_episode><id>174</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/3465868-img0016cch.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/3465868-img0016cch.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/3465868-img0016cch.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/3465868-img0016cch.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/3465868-img0016cch.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/3465868-img0016cch.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/3465868-img0016cch.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><last_episode><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/episode/4070-4614/]]></api_detail_url><id>4614</id><name><![CDATA[By the Skin of the Dragon's Teeth/At the Babysitter's]]></name><episode_number>103</episode_number></last_episode><name><![CDATA[Superman]]></name><publisher><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/publisher/4010-10/]]></api_detail_url><id>10</id><name><![CDATA[DC Comics]]></name></publisher><site_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/superman/4075-174/]]></site_detail_url><start_year>1988</start_year><resource_type><![CDATA[series]]></resource_type></series><series><aliases><![CDATA[The New Batman/Superman Adventures]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/series/4075-12/]]></api_detail_url><count_of_episodes>54</count_of_episodes><date_added>2013-09-24 13:29:52</date_added><date_last_updated>2014-03-11 17:05:42</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[The animated adventures of Superman.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p>Following the critical success of <a href="//www.comicvine.com/batman-the-animated-series/4075-17/" data-ref-id="4075-17">Batman: The Animated Series</a>, DC's most iconic hero received the same in-universe animated treatment by the same creative team of <a href="/paul-dini/4040-42061/" data-ref-id="4040-42061">Paul Dini</a>, <a href="/bruce-timm/4040-7365/" data-ref-id="4040-7365">Bruce Timm</a> and <a href="/alan-burnett/4040-45108/" data-ref-id="4040-45108">Alan Burnett</a> that brought the Dark Knight to animation.</p><p>Due to the nature of Superman, the producers introduced a host of familiar faces into the DC animated universe (as they wanted Batman: The Animated Series to be more grounded in reality).
